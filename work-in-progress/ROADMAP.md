## The Vision

**Rye OS** — a system that belongs wholly to the one who runs it. One language (Rye), one value model, one kernel (Caravan), one compositor (Brushstroke), one shell (Rishi), one version history (Mantra), one network (Comlink), one database (Tablecloth), one composition language (Brix), one data notation (Bron), one memory model (Tally), one boot (Aurora), one enclosure (Pond). **Linengrow** is the flagship application those modules serve — transparent civic commerce grown from the same spine. Each module individually simple; together they compose a desktop, a forge, a network, and a boot — on x86_64 today and RISC-V as the horizon.

**Rye today** is a thin, honest frontend on pinned Zig 0.16.0 — `rye/lib/std` leaned upon through pristine symlinks, safety living in authored `.rye` (assertions at call sites, `width-check.rish`, the trio). The strengthening chronicle **completed** as analysis; it is record, not product.

The full design lives in [`active-designing/yonder/20260619-225712_the-whole-system.md`](../active-designing/yonder/20260619-225712_the-whole-system.md). This roadmap says what to build and in what order.

---

## Two Tracks, One Spine

Rye OS is the system. **Linengrow** is the first whole built upon it — a transparent civic and social-commerce platform for vegan musicians and activist creators. The two share one architectural spine: state as a pure fold over an append-only log of immutable signed facts, and five foundations beneath everything — keypair, signed event, log, projection, capability.

Correctness by construction in the kernel becomes trust by construction in the platform. The same capability that isolates a process in Caravan names ownership in Linengrow; the same Mantra log that versions a file records a verifiable receipt; the same Comlink that seals a datagram delivers a signed transaction identity to identity. Rye OS grows the infrastructure laps; Linengrow grows its application laps on the same modules. The full Linengrow vision lives in [`../linengrow/`](../linengrow/); this roadmap grows it the SLC way, smallest lovable complete first. The granular plan for both tracks lives in [`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md).

## Local macOS proposal-to-Urbit thread (`20260713.201910`)

*A parallel thread to the product roadmap below: this `~/urbit` clone lives on Keaton's Mac under a fresh `keatondun@gmail.com` / `xykj61` identity, layered over `urbit/urbit` and `urbit/vere` histories, and developed in the open as a **collaborative pull-request proposal to Urbit** — an infinite game played with the project, not a competitive fork against it (spirit named in [`../gratitude/TechnoOptimistManifesto.md`](../gratitude/TechnoOptimistManifesto.md)). **Landed:** Pass 1 repo mechanics + keys + Pacific-time convention; both forges pushed and signature-verified; the macOS enclosure equivalent (`sandbox-exec` launcher, witnessed green) + setup guide; the design thread — **Glow** named as the fused Rye-Hoon language, four variants (Riyo/Reya/Trey/Triz) proposed, Nock interpreter and Glow TAME supplement scoped, the grain lineage held whole and siloed; a root README + `GLOW_PROFILE.bron` + root rule 9 (docs↔implementation sync); the **warm-aura date atom** naming the whole tree's one clock ([`../context/specs/20260714-024800_warm-aura-date-atom-naming.md`](../context/specs/20260714-024800_warm-aura-date-atom-naming.md)); the `.peal` audio easter egg + Glow audio-Tilak lane. **Confirmed since (`20260714`):** the fork→proposal reframe (committed + re-signed + force-pushed); all four OS-variant names (Reya·Riyo·Trey·Triz) as two diverse-redundant pairs; the Ojjo O-vane name; and the Pool P-vane proposed (Gall-expanded content-creation computational data market, zero kernel collision). **Open (Keaton's word):** Pool confirm; the diverse-redundancy build shape; Ojjo/Pool build timing; Azimuth/Comlink integration; vere issue migration; seating the Glow supplement; host FileVault. Granular boxes in [`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md).*

**The archiving/reviving sweep is a naming-alignment, not a file-move** — settled `20260714.000100` (no bulk flatten) and aligned `20260714.024800` to the warm-aura date atom: every dated folder is bare `YYYYMMDD` (the `session-logs/archive/` pattern), every version/filename stamp is the one atom, and every future fold has one rule to follow.

The first lap needs no ledger and no currency — only the foundations Rye OS already grows.

## The Keystone Revival — Pool (Gall's role), with Realidream as its Landscape (prioritized `20260715.172000`)

*The single most load-bearing Urbit-vane revival for Glow, prioritized this stamp: **Gall — the userspace application host — revived as Pool**, with **Realidream** as its Landscape-parallel viewer. Ames and Clay already live as Comlink and Mantra (green); identity half-lives as Kumara. What Glow lacks is the host that turns that green spine into a system a person can inhabit — and everything at the product layer (Linengrow, Open Asks, the sanctuary care log, the content market, Greencandy) is Gall-shaped. Pool composes Caravan's supervision + capability table (arguably ahead of Gall's current model) rather than starting cold; Realidream renders what Pool hosts as a pure fold from Weave to the frame — the alternative to Urbit's Landscape, grown on a capability-secured, witnessed spine. Full brief: [`../external-research/20260715-172000_pool-keystone-revival-realidream-landscape.md`](../external-research/20260715-172000_pool-keystone-revival-realidream-landscape.md). **Ladder fully closed `20260715.205500`** — checkable register: all four rungs below are green witnesses, not a pending design.*

| Rung | Name | What it is | Gate |
|------|------|------------|------|
| **P0** | **Pool host seam** | **GREEN `20260715.201500`** — hosts one agent over Caravan's own capability table (imported real); admission is a capability check, not a name check; the agent's state is a verified MALA fold. Five claims witnessed (granted-admitted-folds · ungranted-refused · read-only-refused · deterministic · tampered-refused). First tenant a minimal ledger agent; the closed Open Ask loop is the P1 tenant | ~~done~~ |
| **P1** | **Two agents, one capability boundary** | **GREEN `20260715.202500`** — two agents, each owning its own state resource in Caravan's table, cannot touch each other's state without a named grant; five claims (independent folds · mutual isolation · grant-is-the-only-bridge · grant-does-not-leak) | ~~done~~ |
| **R1** | **Realidream first view over Pool** | **GREEN `20260715.204500`** — Sala renders a Pool-hosted agent's folded state as a bounded frame, sourced from a real Pool `AgentResult`; four claims (frame reflects the fold · deterministic · bounded thin-view · only what Pool hosts is shown) | ~~done~~ |
| **R2** | **Realidream as the unified viewer** | **GREEN `20260715.205500`** — ask · receipt · reputation, each a capability-isolated Pool agent on one Sala surface, each a bounded fold; four claims (three distinct-fold panels · deterministic · bounded · only-what-Pool-admitted). Closes the keystone ladder; the second thin-view consumer that graduates Dexter | ~~done~~ |

**Aligned direction, reconciled `20260716.080000`** — every rung this lane named is now green, closed across five successive reconciliations in one continuous thread. **Landed since the `070000` reconciliation above (now itself superseded):** **the dec jet** — a real, hand-built self-recursive Nock core proven identical to its native fast counterpart, dispatched via a real hint-tag mechanism, with the interpreter's own depth limit measured and named rather than guessed; the **riscv64 parity witness now covers nine keystone pieces**. This closes the "genuinely new design territory" door named at the `070000` reconciliation's own close — the jet layer is no longer a horizon, it is a real, witnessed lap. **The honest next step stays a check-in**: M1 (the NixOS Framework host), B3 (Quin's first hosted-agent lap — a new domain), and the Glow TAME supplement (Keaton's specific word on a heavily-cited canon file) are unchanged. The one remaining named door in this whole thread — a Hoon-to-Nock compiler front end — stays exactly what it was named: meaningfully bigger than a single lap, genuinely new design territory, worth its own check-in before starting, not attempted here.

**Align pass, `20260716.115927`** — Keaton resumed, by his own explicit word this turn, the separate GrapheneOS/Pixel SLC thread the `084500` reconciliation named as "paused... to focus here instead." This is not a correction to the direction above (the Pool/RISC-V/Nock thread stays exactly as landed); it is a second, parallel front reopening on Keaton's own hand, same as the macOS session opened it in the first place. Two real items closed in reopening it: the **Genode-vs-GrapheneOS `G0` naming collision** named honestly-but-unfixed at `20260716.110152` is now fixed (**waymark** scheme, `context/specs/20260716-115927_waymark-ladder-naming-and-g0-collision-fix.md`, hash family corrected to this tree's own SHA3-512 at `124840`; the GrapheneOS/Pixel ladder's own G0–G3 renamed **HAWM0–HAWM3**, the Genode/seL4 proven-seat ladder's bare G0/G1 unchanged); and the Framework host's own jail-local signing identity (`tools/generate_jail_local_keys_linux.rish`) is now run and recorded (`PUBKEYS.md`, `keys/`). **G2 naming** (the seL4-kernel-swap/hw-kernel/Sculpt-integration word from the "Now" table above) stays exactly where it already sat — Open, parked, no new urgency either way — while HAWM0 (KVM-accelerated Android emulation, the closest rung to a demoable Pixel-line artifact) is the thread's own next real fork, gated on one still-open policy question named in `work-in-progress/TASKS.md`'s own Framework-host bullet: how HAWM0 gets its KVM access without widening the already-ruled `lane_kvm` A-narrow boundary (counsel `20260712.090512`) unnamed. No Pixel device owned yet; every reachable rung today is emulation.

**Continued, `20260716.131010`** — HAWM0's own KVM-policy question, named as open two paragraphs above, is answered (host-terminal one-shot) and the setup work behind it is now landed: a checksum-verified JDK and Android SDK staged under `tools/.cache/hawm0/`, an AVD built and hand-tuned to the real Pixel 10 Pro XL's own panel spec, the `emulator` binary itself smoke-tested. Converted `20260716.132100` from a bare shell script to a Rish entrypoint over the same bash worker — Rish's own `run` is blocking-only, so the actual backgrounded boot stays in `tools/hawm0_boot_worker.sh`, mirroring `tools/lane_kvm_onpath_host.rish`'s own relationship to `tools/proven_seat_g0c_lane_kvm.sh` exactly.

**HAWM0 GREEN, `20260716.132659`** — Keaton ran `rishi/bin/rishi run tools/hawm0_boot_onpath_host.rish` from a plain host terminal, exactly as the KVM ruling asked for. Real result: the `hawm0` AVD booted a genuine Android 16 userland (`sdk_gphone64_x86_64`, x86_64) with `sys.boot_completed=1` after 11 seconds and `ro.kernel.qemu=1` confirming real KVM acceleration engaged, not TCG fallback. **This is the first rung on the entire GrapheneOS/Pixel ladder to move from horizon to checkable** — the SLC line now has a real, running, accelerated Android target to build and test the Sala broadcaster client against (HAWM1, unblocked on its own gate for the first time). No Pixel device owned yet; HAWM0 proves the emulated path all the way through, which is the honest ceiling of what emulation alone can prove — HAWM2 (real GrapheneOS build) and HAWM3 (physical device) remain the only rungs that touch GrapheneOS's own hardening.

**HAWM1 witness landed, `20260716.133618`** — Keaton chose HAWM1 as the next door over HAWM2 and the Pixel-shopping thread. `tools/hawm1_sala_witness.rish` cross-builds the already-proven Sala B0 witness for `x86_64-linux-android`, pushes it onto the real booted device, and asserts its session root agrees with the native run bit for bit — the M0 aarch64/qemu-user claim carried from emulated-Linux-binary onto a real Android device. Both cross-builds (native, android-target) are confirmed real and deterministic from inside this jail alone; the `adb push`/`adb shell` half needs the running `hawm0` emulator and is the next real host-terminal action.

**Real bug caught live, `20260716.140207`** — Keaton ran HAWM0's own boot script (GREEN, twice), then HAWM1's witness immediately after, and hit "no emulator attached" both times. Root cause: HAWM0's own boot worker armed a cleanup trap that fired on *every* exit, including success — the boot script was killing its own device the instant it finished proving that device booted. Fixed by disarming the trap right before the GREEN close, so a successful boot now stays up on purpose; only a genuine failure still tears the emulator down. `tools/hawm0_stop.sh` is the new, explicit way to stop it when actually done. Named plainly as a real design mistake this session made and caught, not a user error.

**Third pass, same thread, `20260716.141522`** — the fix landed correctly, and the very next call surfaced a second, related bug: HAWM0's own "already attached" guard, written for an era when every run self-terminated, still treated a healthy re-run as a hard failure rather than the idempotent success it now is. Fixed by checking `sys.boot_completed` on the existing device before deciding — booted means GREEN and done, only genuinely stuck means refuse. Verified all three real decision branches in an isolated unit test before trusting it. Also closed a visibility gap across both HAWM0's and HAWM1's own Rish entrypoints: a real failure's stderr reason was captured, yet never shown to the terminal, only left in log files — now printed directly on any RED close.

**HAWM1 GREEN, `20260716.141946`** — the fourth run in this same thread, and the one that finally closes it: Keaton's own real `hawm1_sala_witness.rish` run pushed Glow's cross-built Sala B0 witness onto the real, KVM-booted device and its session root matched the native reference exactly. **HAWM0 and HAWM1 are both now real, closed, checkable rungs.** A stronger claim than M0's own aarch64/qemu-user result — this proves Glow's fold survives Android's actual bionic libc, not merely its CPU architecture, on real hardware acceleration rather than user-mode emulation. Worth naming plainly: reaching this GREEN took two real bugfix rounds after the witness itself was already correct, both caught live rather than assumed away — the same discipline this whole thread has kept throughout.

**A parallel thread opened alongside HAWM, `20260716.142818`–`145955`** — the Glow application-framework question (which vanes match GrapheneOS's own app-store and publishing mechanism, and how the rune design connects to it) was expanded into a full plan naming the waymark-derived **TUBE** ladder, then TUBE0 (the app-manifest mold) landed real and GREEN. Checking what already existed before building the next recommended step (a `|-` parser prototype) found `glow/rune_bounded_trap.rye` already real, landed earlier the same day — a second rune category (`^-`, the cast rune) was built instead, proving the front-end shape generalizes past the one rune `|-` started with, rather than duplicating work already done. Both the TUBE and rune threads stay honestly small: one manifest mold, two rune-head parsers, no general Glow parser or lowering pass yet.

**Aligned next step (this align pass, `20260716.145955`):** the two live threads — HAWM (mobile emulation, both reachable rungs closed) and TUBE/rune (application framework, one manifest mold and two rune-head parsers) — are each honestly small and each correctly gated on Keaton's own word for what comes next (a third rune category, TUBE1's agent-runtime gate, the Sala broadcaster app, or HAWM2/HAWM3's hardware doors). Nothing here needs a ruling before the next mechanical step; the one standing item worth naming plainly is the pre-existing `copyForwards` RED (four files, dated `20260714`–`20260715`, confirmed unrelated to anything landed today) — a real, small, already-scoped cleanup, not urgent, not blocking, and not yet anyone's explicit ask.

**That standing item closed, `20260716.190324`** — asked to choose the best next path with no further steer, took the pre-existing RED over a third rune category: it was an actual failing check already sitting in the tree, blocking every full-chapter parity run from ever reaching TUBE0 or either rune witness this session landed, which made "the suite is green" a claim this tree could not actually stand behind. Migrated all four `copyForwards` sites to `tally/copy.rye`'s own `copy_disjoint` (checked each call site's own source/target for genuine disjointness before touching anything, per the ban's own reasoning — none aliased). Fixing it surfaced a second, deeper pre-existing ban underneath (six compound `assert(X and Y)` sites across four more files, unrelated to today's own work) — split each into named halves so a failing half names itself rather than hiding behind a merged condition, then rebuilt and reran every witness either fix touched, all GREEN, before trusting the full chapter again.

**A third, much larger layer surfaced immediately after, and was deliberately left open rather than fixed unilaterally.** With both bans clear, the full chapter ran further than it ever had this session and reached a genuinely new halt: `tools/two_rooms_doorway.rish`'s own scan refuses any dated page (post-`20260705.203144`) whose `**Status:**` line does not literally contain one of `checkable|vision|mixed|research for understanding`. Three `active-designing/` pages (`20260714.184500`, two from `20260715`) were real, minimal oversights — each already named its register in prose ("design/research... Two Rooms — a proposal") without using the scanner's own exact word — fixed by adding the honest word `Vision register (Two Rooms)` to each Status line, changing no meaning. Re-running the scan then surfaced the real size of the gap: **25 more failures, every one in `external-research/`**, dated across `20260712`–`20260715`, none touched this session — a long-standing, systemic mismatch between the scanner's own narrow four-word list and this tree's actual prevailing convention (`Design and research`, `Study → design`, `Scoping`, and the like, all clearly design-register in meaning, none matching the regex literally). Deciding whether the scanner's own word list is too narrow or two dozen docs need editing is a real design call, not a mechanical fix — named here plainly and left for its own dedicated pass rather than either reverted or bulk-edited under an unrelated commit.

**A real device joins the thread, `20260716.193409`** — Keaton bought a used Google Pixel 10a, 128GB, for $325 (Facebook Marketplace). Checked directly against Google's own spec sheet and GrapheneOS's own support page: Tensor G4, Titan M2, full GrapheneOS *production* support, a self-install web installer, updates through `~2033` — a genuinely good price against `~$450–550` new. This satisfies HAWM3's own device gate and lands, honestly, in the go-to-market brief's own value tier one generation newer than the 7a/8a class that brief named — ahead of the flagship purchase its own ordering plans for, which the tier table welcomes rather than conflicts with. HAWM3 itself stays open until GrapheneOS is actually flashed on the device; that flash is now the nearest real hardware step on this whole thread, reachable whenever Keaton has the ~15–30 minutes the official web installer needs.

**GrapheneOS is real on the device, `20260717.013213`** — Keaton followed [`manual/guides/pixel-10a-grapheneos-setup.md`](../manual/guides/pixel-10a-grapheneos-setup.md)'s own eight steps end to end and GrapheneOS is installed and running on the physical Pixel 10a. **This is the first rung on the entire GrapheneOS/Pixel ladder to touch real hardware rather than emulation** — HAWM0's own KVM-accelerated Android 16 userland proved Glow's own code correct on emulation; this is the real Titan M2, the real locked bootloader, the real hardware root of trust the whole ladder's "prove the compute, not the platform" honesty has pointed toward since it opened. `context/specs/two-dev-environments-and-mobile-emulation.md`'s own HAWM3 rung and top-level register now name this real. **The chain of trust is now checked, not assumed, `20260717.013700`** — Keaton read the yellow boot notice's own SHA-256 hash directly off the device and matched it, digit for digit, against GrapheneOS's own published Pixel 10a value at `grapheneos.org/install/web` (`d8f879d10419eddc9fcda6280718be763f6bf12299e1f72df3ea8ad8a8eb7f80`). **HAWM3 is closed** — not merely an OS that boots and looks right, but a verified-boot signature this exact hardware, this exact build, actually produced. The nearest next real step: the first on-device HAWM-ladder proof — running Glow/Sala userland code on the real hardware itself, closing the loop HAWM0/HAWM1 opened on emulation.

**No Kotlin transpiler; a native-activity shim instead, `20260717.014522`** — Keaton asked plainly whether Glow should grow a DSL that transpiles to Kotlin for SLC apps, or whether a more TAME-guided, bounded path already exists. Answer, named in [`active-designing/20260717-014522_native-activity-shim-and-slc-packaging.md`](../active-designing/20260717-014522_native-activity-shim-and-slc-packaging.md): no transpiler. Glow's Android path is already native (Zig → bionic ELF, proven bit-identical on HAWM1, HAWM3 pending) and a JVM target would fight TAME's own bounds/allocation/error discipline for no real gain. The actual gap is packaging, not language: HAWM1/HAWM3 push bare ELF binaries via `adb shell exec`, which proves correctness yet is not an installable app — Android requires an APK with a Binder-registered `Activity`. The named fix is one small, fixed, hand-written **native-activity shim** (never generated, reused verbatim across every Glow app) that hands the window surface across a JNI seam to the Glow-built `.so`, where every rune, bound, and assertion still lives. **New rung named: TUBE0.5, "first installable Glow APK on GrapheneOS,"** gated on TUBE0 (GREEN) and HAWM3 (closed) — both gates now closed, the rung itself still horizon until the shim is actually written.

**TUBE0.5 host-side packaging GREEN, `20260717.021857`** — the missing installable-APK rung now has real code and three GREEN witnesses: closed-table permission emission (`linengrow/tube_manifest_android_permission.rye`), a full AndroidManifest.xml naming Android's own `NativeActivity` with `hasCode=false` and fixed lib `glowapp` (`linengrow/tube_android_manifest.rye` — no custom Kotlin or Java at all), and a signed demo APK (`tools/tube05_apk_pack_witness.rish`) carrying `lib/arm64-v8a/libglowapp.so` that exports `ANativeActivity_onCreate`. The envelope uses Android's own NativeActivity class rather than a generated Activity — even smaller than the brief's "50–100 line shim" once the platform's own class is reused honestly.

**Sala B0 fold inside NativeActivity, `20260717.121445`** — `ANativeActivity_onCreate` now runs the same three-event Sala B0 demo fold HAWM1 already proved bit-identical (`linengrow/sala_b0_fold.rye`, root `99b3ae96…e4c5fe`), records it in `glow_last_session_root_hex`, and writes `/data/user/0/org.glow.app.sala_broadcaster/files/sala_root.txt`. Pack path is `rye build-lib -fsingle-threaded` → static `.a` → NDK `clang -shared` for both `arm64-v8a` and `x86_64` (Zig's plain `-dynamic` android `.so` lacks `DT_NEEDED` and fails `dlopen`). Pack-worker ASCII hygiene fixed after a UTF-8 em-dash broke bash quote parsing mid-pack. Witness GREEN: `rishi/bin/rishi run tools/tube05_apk_pack_witness.rish`. Host one-shot for the remaining slice: `tools/tube05_install_proof_onpath_host.rish`.

**Align pass, `20260717.121800`** — compass rose walked (foundations → grain → Two Rooms → active-designing → TASKS/ROADMAP → witnesses). HAWM0/HAWM1 GREEN, HAWM3 closed, TUBE0.5 host-side packaging GREEN with Sala fold inside the APK — all checkable. Batch roll-up: [`session-logs/20260717-121800_align-send-ten-batches.md`](../session-logs/20260717-121800_align-send-ten-batches.md). Named host-terminal install proof as the one next step.

**TUBE0.5 on-device install GREEN, `20260717.122010`** — Keaton ran from a plain host terminal: HAWM0 booted KVM-accelerated (`sys.boot_completed=1` in 1s, `model=sdk_gphone64_x86_64 android=16 abi=x86_64 qemu=1`), then `tools/tube05_install_proof_onpath_host.rish` installed `org.glow.app.sala_broadcaster`, launched NativeActivity, and `run-as` read `files/sala_root.txt` = `99b3ae967c5a230acfc598a7e949b3c2c638ce996be47a51a7c9f8cb12e4c5fe` — the same HAWM1 demo root. **TUBE0.5's host-side pack and on-emulator install halves are both checkable GREEN.**

**TUBE0.5 on Pixel 10a GREEN, `20260717.123226`** — same install proof on the physical GrapheneOS Pixel (`66041JEA306288`, `product=stallion model=Pixel_10a`): adb authorized after the on-device Allow dialog, APK installed, NativeActivity launched, `sala_root.txt` again `99b3ae96…e4c5fe`. **TUBE0.5 is checkable end to end — pack, HAWM0, and real Titan-class hardware.**

**NativeActivity finish after fold, `20260717.124029`** — onCreate writes `sala_root.txt` then calls `ANativeActivity_finish` (`-landroid`). Pixel re-proof GREEN — the proof file remains readable; the blank window no longer hangs.

**First NativeActivity surface, `20260717.124458`** — success path keeps the activity alive and paints the Sala session-root hex on the ANativeWindow (`glow_native_surface.rye`: software RGBA lock, 5×7 bitmap font). Fold + file proof unchanged in onCreate. Pack witness GREEN. **Seen on the Pixel `20260717.124843`** — Keaton confirmed the hex readable on the GrapheneOS device; install proof still GREEN.

**Surface chrome + tap to close, `20260717.125302`** — title / match-green hex / `TAP TO CLOSE`; motion-up on the input queue finishes the activity. Keaton confirmed on the Pixel.

**Skate on Android glass, `20260717.125858`** — NativeActivity presents a Brushstroke Skate grid (same `skate_grid.rye` as the desktop viewer) onto the ANativeWindow. Keaton confirmed the look on the GrapheneOS Pixel. Thin-view / richer frames stay later; debug keystore stays host-local.

**TUBE glass path through TUBE7, `20260717.145547`** — after Skate/R1/R2, the Pixel presents TUBE1 admit, TUBE5 tip, TUBE2 publish, TUBE3 sealed fetch, and TUBE4 market acquire as Skate lines under the Sala panels (device-free TUBE2–5 witnesses already GREEN). Install proof still binds `sala_root.txt`; Keaton confirmed each glass line. **TUBE7 (packaging + rail present on physical Pixel) is GREEN** for this demo stack. **TUBE6** (whole stack on a real GrapheneOS *build*) stays horizon behind **HAWM2**. Compressor: [`docs/TUBE.md`](../docs/TUBE.md). Batch still local until Keaton says send.

**Third rune category — `?:`, `20260717.145912`** — after the glass ladder closed, the named keep-going on the language path: [`glow/rune_conditional.rye`](../glow/rune_conditional.rye) parses the if/then/else **test** child (parenthesized or bare ident), same head-only discipline as `|-` and `^-`. Witness GREEN; `parity_ch01` wired.

**Fourth rune head — `?-`, `20260717.150005`** — [`glow/rune_switch.rye`](../glow/rune_switch.rye) parses the exhaustive-switch **subject** (`kind.cur-record`). Witness GREEN; `parity_ch01` wired.

**Fifth rune head — `=/`, `20260717.150053`** — [`glow/rune_face.rye`](../glow/rune_face.rye) opens the `=` bindings category: face + optional mold. Witness GREEN; `parity_ch01` wired.

**Sixth rune head — `?~`, `20260717.150219`** — [`glow/rune_null.rye`](../glow/rune_null.rye) deepens the `?` category with the null-test subject. Witness GREEN; `parity_ch01` wired. The brief's composition heads (`|-` · `?~` · `=/` · `?-` · `?:`) each have a front half; general lowering stays later.

**Seventh rune head — `=.`, `20260717.150409`** — [`glow/rune_mutate.rye`](../glow/rune_mutate.rye) deepens the `=` category (mutate one leg). Witness GREEN; `parity_ch01` wired.

**Eighth rune head — `=*`, `20260717.150453`** — [`glow/rune_alias.rye`](../glow/rune_alias.rye) completes the `=` trio. Witness GREEN; `parity_ch01` wired.

**First Glow generator hop, `20260717.151000`** — literal `|-` lowers to ordinary `.rye` ([`glow/lower_trap.rye`](../glow/lower_trap.rye)); desk file [`glow/gen/bound-tick.glow`](../glow/gen/bound-tick.glow); Rishi hand [`tools/glow_run.rish`](../tools/glow_run.rish). Naming hold: Glow = language, Rishi = shell. Next: more heads' lowering, or `(lent …)` — still no general lexer.

## The Visual Track — Realidream (horizon lane, ladder already named)

*Where Linengrow's SLC product gets designed and **seen** — every surface a pure fold from Weave to the frame, per the three living essays. Opened `20260708.021912` from the grain-sketchbook mining ([study](../external-research/20260708-021912_grain-sketchbook-realidream-mining.md) · [counsel](../counsel/20260708-021912_claude-counsel-realidream-zig016-brix.md)); the sketchbook's unified DAG UI backend (Aurora + Skate + Realidream) is this lane's direct ancestor, its event DAG the unsigned ancestor of Weave itself. **This lane now sits under the Pool keystone revival above** — Realidream's rungs are the R-rungs there, rendered over what Pool hosts.*

| Rung | Name | State | Gate |
|------|------|-------|------|
| 0 | **Weave slice + Kumara** | **landed** — I2 export + identity seam; Ed25519 ratchet **0** (`030200`) | — |
| 1 | **SLC-2a drawn terminal (Skate viewer)** | **active rung** — thin view (MALA/WOV **202**); books view (Greencandy TB + P&L/BS **208**); **sight view** (carriage + books + journal **210**/**290**); assist plain+journal **288**/**289** | already in Now |
| 2 | **Pond's first policy** | held | Pond's own word |
| 3 | **Dexter graduation** | **graduated `20260715.205500`** — Sala R2 (the unified viewer) is the second thin-view consumer the rule waited for | ~~second consumer arrives~~ — arrived |
| 4 | **Realidream** | horizon — ask, receipt, reputation, sanctuary page rendered as views over Weave; thin-view exception proves local facts → frame without Pond/Dexter | rungs 1–3 |

**Gratitude shelf for the lane:** Hyperfiddle (Dustin Getz — UIs as streaming DAGs) · Matklad (project-wide semantic graph) · the Nostr protocol (signed-event, relay-subscribed shape — [`nips/`](../gratitude/nips/)) · TigerBeetle (already kept) · grain-sketchbook (Kaeden's archived prototype — [`grain-sketchbook.md`](../gratitude/grain-sketchbook.md)) · Noah B. (name's artistic source — [`noah-b-realidream.md`](../gratitude/noah-b-realidream.md)). **Affirmed `174500`.** **Departures the lane keeps:** immutable facts re-folded, never nodes patched; meaning per-entry via Tilak, never one shared enum across consumers; values cross seams as Bron, never JSON-in-a-payload.

### The Audio Tilak lane — `.peal`, and Glow over sound (horizon, opened `20260714.023700`)

*Opened from the `anvil/anvil.peal` easter egg — the first audio bytes in the tree (Opus-in-Ogg under a four-letter Glow-compatible mark; gratitude [`../gratitude/OpusOggXiph.md`](../gratitude/OpusOggXiph.md)). A struck anvil should ring, so the forge module carries the first peal.* The lane grows a real capability, smallest-first, so Glow code can process audio as an ordinary value the system already knows how to fold:

| Rung | Name | What it is | Gate |
|------|------|------------|------|
| **A0** | **`.peal` mark exists** | **landed** — a servable Opus-in-Ogg stream at `anvil/anvil.peal`, tracked (not gitignored), decode-verified | done `023700` |
| **A1** | **Peal Tilak** | a Glow type-mark for a `.peal` value: `absorb` (bytes → peal), `express` (peal → duration/channels/bitrate summary, waveform frame), `tend` (peal history in its own grain) — the same three Tilak duties every marked value keeps ([`../context/LEXICON.md`](../context/LEXICON.md)) | Tilak family stable; a real audio consumer asks |
| **A2** | **Peal over Weave** | a peal enters Weave as a content-addressed resin (SHA3 name), so Glow code folds over it exactly as it folds over text and receipts — audio as a first-class value, not a blob beside the system | A1 · Weave resin tiers |
| **A3** | **Brushstroke peal view** | a Brushstroke component that renders a peal's waveform/metadata as an immediate-mode frame — Landscape/Realidream-compatible, drawn from the value every frame, per the three living essays | A2 · Brushstroke frame seam · Realidream rung 1 |
| **A4** | **Maitreya time seam** | playback/decode as a bounded host seam under **Maitreya** (the media driver already named in `LEXICON.md` for audio/video time), so Realidream can play a peal through the same seam Lotus and Linengrow will | A3 · Maitreya first lap |

**Departures this lane keeps (same as Realidream's):** the peal is an immutable signed value re-folded, never a mutable buffer patched; its meaning rides a Tilak, never a shared enum; it crosses seams as Bron-wrapped bytes, never an untyped payload. **The codec stays borrowed and free; the mark stays ours** — anything needing raw Opus re-probes in one step.

**Lap 1 close (`224805`):** the fixture-served contract family is whole — activations through ELU/min/max, sampling pins through `n`/`presence_penalty`, Scribble combos, and exception folds on glass. **Anvil corpus lap 2** (`225320`) deepens catalog filters through tip **386**. **Greencandy lap 4** (`230433`) deepens journal filters and cash flow through tip **394**. Further Inference Track work opens at rung **2** (ROCm) or another named lap on Kaeden's word.

## Horizon 3 — Deliberated horizons (not today's primary track)

| Horizon | What |
|---------|------|
| **Steep** | Peer file sharing — sealed content-addressed pieces; TAME Rye alternative spirit to BitTorrent; named `210433` — [`hammock`](../active-designing/20260710-210433_steep-peer-file-sharing-name.md); first lap not opened |
| **Language fork** | Self-hosted compiler, Rye-native `std` — revisited from a **mature whole** when RISC-V-first genuinely demands it ([`20260628-043542` direction](../active-designing/20260628-043542_thin-frontend-slc-direction.md)) |
| **Whole machine** | Aurora on RISC-V, full desktop, Brushstroke web-portable, Rye OS on open silicon |
| **Inference stack** | **Lap 1 closed** tip **378**; Anvil **386**; Greencandy lap 4 **394**; fixture deepen **410**; glass composition tip **418** (`234004`); RW-5 tips **420**/**421** (`005028`); assist integration tip **428** (`025301`); next rung **2** ROCm (horizon) |

Prior fork steps F0–F5 remain documented in [`active-designing/yonder/20260621-070712_the-compiler-fork.md`](../active-designing/yonder/20260621-070712_the-compiler-fork.md) as **research**, not the active build order.

## Horizon 1 — What to Build Next

### Build (SLC 1 first)

**Gate before the SLC-1 merge:** ~~`rishi/bin/rishi run tools/parity.rish` green once on metal~~ **done** (`2026-06-28`) — parity suite green; SLC-1 witnesses registered (now **132** total with hosted `width-check`).

**SLC-1 build order** (granular; mirrors [`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md)):

| Step | Verb | What lands | Witness |
|------|------|------------|---------|
| **1 — type + run** | Type, Run | `rishi repl`; prompt `rishi> `; in-process eval; shared `Env`; `:quit` / `:q` | `tools/slc1_repl_step1.rish` — binding carry-forward |
| **2 — version** | Version | Session buffer; `.mantra/session.log` transcript; `:history`; lazy `mantra init`; `:version` → `mantra add` | `tools/slc1_version_step2.rish` — HEAD advances; blob in `.mantra/blobs/` |
| **3 — recall** | Recall | `:recall <n>` and `!<n>`; in-session rerun via `runInputLine` | `tools/slc1_recall_step3.rish` — prior line re-runs |
| **accept** | all four | Meta-commands in `rishi/README`; the trio on metal | `tools/slc1_accept.rish` — type, run, version, recall in one session |

**SLC-1 is done** on its functional promise (`2026-06-29`). **TAME hardening is complete** (`2026-06-29`) — TH-0–TH-7, RS-1–RS-3, hosted `width-check` blocking in parity (132 witnesses). The bench turns to the next product lap.

**Landed since this section was drawn:** SLC-2a Laps 1–3 witnessed with metalsmoke GREEN (parity **140**); Caravan capability table (`2026-06-30`); RW-3 and RW-4 (**141**, **142**); fixture twins in Rishi; the manual's first reference and tutorial.

**The current position — doors closed, ladder open** (granular boxes in [`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md)):

| Step | Owner | Parity |
|------|-------|--------|
| Door 1 — Pond clause · Door 2 — Lap 3 metal close · Door 3 — Edit 5 ruling | **Kaeden** | ✅ closed |
| Edit 5 wired | Cursor | **143** ✅ |
| **Amber first lap** — five rungs (a)–(e) | Cursor | **144** ✅ |
| SLC-2b — keyboard from the window, Dexter's genesis | Cursor | **145** ✅ |
| RW-1 mirrored pair — Rishi↔Mantra seam | Cursor | **147** ✅ |
| Chrono version sweep — authored surfaces | Cursor | **148** ✅ |
| RW-2 mirrored pair — app↔Brushstroke seam | Cursor | **150** ✅ |
| Happy-zone second pass — Inference Track | Cursor | audit `001225` ✅; next season **RW-5** |
| Commerce steward demo — list → settle → Greencandy | Cursor | **419** ✅; live TB still Rest-until |
| RW-5 mirrored pair — Drawn Terminal ↔ Lantern | Cursor | **420**/**421** ✅; contract `005028` |
| Steward composition — list → settle → Greencandy on Skate | Cursor | **422** ✅; hammock `010030` |
| Steward sight — livelihood + books on one Skate frame | Cursor | **423** ✅; hammock `011254` |
| Granary weave steward — list → settle → Greencandy on Skate | Cursor | **424** ✅; hammock `012451` |
| Granary steward sight — weave + books on one Skate frame | Cursor | **425** ✅; hammock `014304` |
| Open Asks view — closed ask loop on Skate | Cursor | **426** ✅; hammock `014454` |
| Open Asks escrow view — Nyasa hold/release on Skate | Cursor | **427** ✅; hammock `015106` |
| RW-5 assist integration — assist glass asks complete_fixture | Cursor | **428** ✅; contract `005028` |
| Open Asks reputation view — consent-before-counting on Skate | Cursor | **429** ✅; hammock `030123` |
| Open Asks civic sight — lifecycle · escrow · consent on Skate | Cursor | **430** ✅; hammock `032657` |
| Door 3 consumer-edge pass — access vs truth (in-process) | Cursor | **431** ✅; hammock `063213` |
| receipt-verify Wasmtime guest — component compile lap | Cursor | **432** ✅; hammock `063558` |
| Vocabulary ground — TWO_ROOMS seat · canonical gloss · doorway witness | Cursor | **153** ✅ |

**Season (`20260705.203144`):** **Linengrow-via-Comlink** — ground first, then **Comlink device wire** (Rye spine step that unlocks SLC-L2 sealed delivery). Zip **47** seals the astrology silo bench (`e8d1919`). **Landed through tip 430** — civic glass arc closed; hold menu [`counsel/20260711-033228_hold-at-tip-430.md`](../counsel/20260711-033228_hold-at-tip-430.md).

**Season (`20260712.052806`):** **Seam season** — nib-430 horizon door named. Universality through the application seam (portable ABI + sealed record carriage + consumer-edge pass), not the hardware summit. **Four RTAC studies landed** through `054521`. CapTP-as-fold declined on counsel (formal seat awaits word); Spritely teacher now / ally after two-sided witness; Caravan stays named horizon (guest, never merger); giving-lane asymmetry filed (private payer · transparent payee). Granular boxes in [`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md).

Still on the prior horizon, after vocabulary ground: **Comlink device wire** — sealed datagram over virtio-net between two QEMU guests — **landed**; **Rishi builtins** as-you-touch.

### Ground (thin frontend)

7. **Std re-fork** — **done** (`20260628`) — pristine symlink; see [`archive/20260628-044300_std-refork-plan.md`](archive/20260628-044300_std-refork-plan.md).

### Study

8. **Display-layer study** — Wayland specs; Ghostty (MIT) for Skate.
9. **Close reading** — Comlink packet format from `gratitude/` before format hardens.

**Retired from active track:** strengthening sweep; pass 9886 as chronicle continuation; "fork is the priority."

## Horizon 2 — Compose the Simples

- [ ] **Pond GUI** — SLC 2
- [ ] **Comlink v1** — typed, content-named, sealed delivery (sealed datagram stays fold carriage; consumer-edge pass is a later composition)
- [ ] **Brix v1** — lawful composition + content-addressed store
- [ ] **Tablecloth v1** — storage for Pond applications
- [ ] **Caravan v1** — supervision tree with capability table (proven-seat guest is study, never merger)
- [ ] **Pond v1** — policy as value
- [ ] **The Forge** — Mantra served, Brushstroke drawn, Comlink replicated
- [ ] **The TAME Editor** — select-then-act in Skate
- [ ] **Comlink Remoting** — value-based state sync over UDP
- [ ] **Unified keys** — one owner seed deriving all keys
- [ ] **Portable component seam** — one ABI for browser / rented server / later Caravan host (Seam study 2)

## The Discipline

- **Ship something simple, lovable, and complete at every step.**
- **Grow; never design the whole from scratch.**
- **Prove each step through its witnesses.**
- **Safety lives in authored code** — assert at call sites; pristine `std` you lean on.
- **Keep it loose and single-stranded.**
- **Two-thirds implementation, one-third design.**

---

*May we grow the whole from what already works, and trust each small running thing as it carries the next. May every horizon arrive by degrees, never by a leap. And may the system we build stay simple enough, at every stage, to be loved, understood, and grown a little further tomorrow.*
