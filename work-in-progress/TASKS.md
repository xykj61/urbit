# Tasks — The Granular Plan

**Language:** EN
**Last updated:** 2026-07-13 (compass align landed · git nib **5c06253**; local macOS fork Pass 1 `20260713.201910`; Glow/naming/lineage design thread `20260713.233147`)

## Local macOS fork — Pass 1 landed `20260713.201910`, Pass 2 open

*A parallel thread, distinct from the product laps below: Kaeden's Mac-hosted `~/urbit` clone, layered over `urbit/urbit` and `urbit/vere` histories under the `xykj61` identity, diverging from the Urbit Foundation on purpose.*

- [x] Mirror-backup `urbit/urbit` and `urbit/vere` to `~/backups/` before any destructive move
- [x] Rebuild `~/urbit` — fresh `urbit/urbit` history at top level, `veganreyklah2` content moved into its place, `old/` holding the original urbit/urbit tree plus a legacy Oct-2025 personal collection (`nockchain`, `urbit.org`) Kaeden asked to nest rather than discard
- [x] Rebuild `~/urbit/vere` — `.git` relocated to `~/.git-vere-backup/` (outside the project), original content under `vere/old/`
- [x] Generate a clean `keatondun@gmail.com` ed25519 identity (2 SSH keys + 1 GPG signing key) and wire it into `~/urbit`'s **local** git config (not global — the global `~/.ssh/config` host aliases already belong to a different identity)
- [x] Add macOS Finder/Spotlight/AppleDouble ignore family to `.gitignore` beside the existing Linux-host `.DS_Store` line; allow-list `old/` and `vere/`
- [x] Seat a Pacific Time (Reno, NV) stamp convention for this local clone — [`context/specs/20260713-201910_pacific-time-local-clone-convention.md`](../context/specs/20260713-201910_pacific-time-local-clone-convention.md)
- [x] **gh CLI auth for `xykj61`** — device flow completed; scope refreshed for `admin:public_key`/`write:gpg_key`; used to add keys and verified `gh auth status`
- [x] Add new SSH/GPG public keys to the `xykj61` GitHub account (via `gh`) and Codeberg account (Kaeden, by hand) — both verified `20260713`–`20260714`
- [x] Create `xykj61/urbit` on GitHub and Codeberg, point `~/urbit` remotes at them — pushed and signature-verified on both forges at commit `def0d3c7`
- [x] **Pass 2, study 1** — macOS enclosure (Seatbelt/`sandbox-exec`) and QEMU-vs-`Virtualization.framework` — [`external-research/20260713-202929_macos-enclosure-and-qemu-vs-vz-study.md`](../external-research/20260713-202929_macos-enclosure-and-qemu-vs-vz-study.md); finding: keep QEMU + `-accel hvf` for the existing wire labs (lowest disruption, ARM64-native already), Pond's macOS enclosure wants its own Rye/Rishi SBPL-profile seam (real work, not a horizon) — study only, no lap opened
- [ ] **Pass 2, remaining:** Azimuth contract address confirmation (web search, current date) and a Comlink↔Ethereum design sketch; `urbit/vere` issue triage via `gh` for recreation in the new fork

### SOURCE.md ai-jail → macOS: granular adaptation (opened `20260713.211800`, first landed `20260714.052900`)

*Cursor ships as a native `.app` on macOS with a `cursor` CLI wrapper (Homebrew-installed, confirmed on this Mac) — no AppImage, no `squashfs-root/AppRun`. The `--user-data-dir` / `--extensions-dir` flags `tools/cursor-jail.sh` already relies on exist unchanged in the macOS build, so the project-local state-directory model ports directly.*

- [x] Author `tools/cursor-jail-macos.sh` — a shell launcher (not yet the Rye/Rishi seed originally proposed; landed as bash first, matching `tools/cursor-jail.sh`'s own POSIX-seam precedent) that generates an SBPL `(deny default)` profile inline and execs `sandbox-exec -f <profile> -- cursor --user-data-dir=... --extensions-dir=... "$REPO"` — [`tools/cursor-jail-macos.sh`](../tools/cursor-jail-macos.sh)
- [x] Witness: `tools/cursor_jail_macos_witness.sh` — **both green on this host** `20260714.052900`: write inside the project succeeds, write outside (to real `$HOME`) is denied with `Operation not permitted`, confirmed with no leaked file
- [x] Guide: [`manual/guides/macos-ai-jail-setup.md`](../manual/guides/macos-ai-jail-setup.md) — the practical setup and troubleshooting path, honest about what is still open
- [ ] A future Rye/Rishi-native `tools/macos_sandbox_profile.rish` seed, replacing the bash SBPL generation, once Rishi's own hosted build is proven on this Mac's arm64 (ties to the RISC-V/ARM64 parity witness-run item)
- [ ] Network egress *filtering* (proxy-based, allow-list by host) — the current script only offers allow-all or deny-all
- [ ] Decide and document the private-`$HOME` equivalent — named as an open gap in the guide; not yet built
- [ ] Extend `context/specs/enclosure-editors.md` with a macOS section alongside the existing Ubuntu/NixOS ones
- [ ] Extend `SOURCE.md` Step 6 and Step 9 with a macOS variant path — the guide above stands alone for now; folding it into `SOURCE.md` itself is a small follow-up
- Session log: [`session-logs/20260713-201910_local-fork-pass1-restructure.bron`](../session-logs/20260713-201910_local-fork-pass1-restructure.bron)

### Glow, kernel-variant naming, and the grain lineage (design thread `20260713`)

*Design and research only — no module renamed, no interpreter or language code written. Every item below is a proposal or a held study awaiting Kaeden's word before anything is seated or built.*

- [x] **Urbit-parallel naming mapping** — every module mapped to a proposed vane / Gall-agent parallel with grep-counted inbound-reference costs; cheapest Skate (10), costliest Rye (1,474) — [`context/specs/20260713-214400_urbit-parallel-naming-mapping-proposal.md`](../context/specs/20260713-214400_urbit-parallel-naming-mapping-proposal.md). **No rename committed; Kaeden reviewing.**
- [x] **Glow accepted as the fused Rye-Hoon language name** — carries the dormant Glow-Lang project's own mission forward under a TAME-strict implementation — [`context/specs/20260713-225658_glow-accepted-riyo-reya-trey-triz-amended.md`](../context/specs/20260713-225658_glow-accepted-riyo-reya-trey-triz-amended.md)
- [x] **Four kernel variants named** — one language (Glow, one TAME document), four variants: **Riyo** + **Reya** (explicit diverse-redundant pair), **Trey** + **Triz** (Tera retired for collision). Collision research: Riyo/Trey quiet; Triz a low-stakes TRIZ soft-collision; Reya collides with ReyaChain and this fork's own retired Reya 2 voice.
- [x] **Four OS-variant names confirmed** `20260714` — Reya (`002123`), then Riyo/Trey/Triz + the two-pair symmetry (`035600`, "approve to gates ... to all"). Riyo/Reya and Trey/Triz are the two diverse-redundant pairs. **Redundancy shape confirmed** `20260714.050500` — **one codebase, two independently-verified execution paths** (not two separate codebases from one spec).
- [x] **Ojjo O-vane confirmed** `20260714.034900`; **build timing confirmed** `20260714.050500` — seated now as a named horizon vane, lap 1 (correctness, no timing) opens when Glow runs its first program.
- [x] **Pool P-vane confirmed** `20260714.042545` — Gall-expanded applications vane, headlined as a content-creation computational data market; **zero collision in the Urbit kernel** (whole `old/` searched), nothing to rename; secularizes the Linengrow foundations to Acme-generic; composes MALA/Neth/Granary/Mandi/Open Asks/Comlink/Sigma/Kumara. Design [`../external-research/20260714-035600_pool-p-vane-content-data-market.md`](../external-research/20260714-035600_pool-p-vane-content-data-market.md). **Framing + timing confirmed** `20260714.050500` — Pool is Glow's **whole application vane** (full Gall-role; market is the flagship, not the whole scope), seated now as a named horizon vane.
- [x] **Quin Q-vane confirmed** `20260714.050500` — inference vane unifying the four voices (**Lantern · Lattice · Anvil · Scribble**) under TAME + Maze guidance; the fifth thing the four make; **kernel-quiet**. Design [`../external-research/20260714-042545_quin-q-vane-inference-voices.md`](../external-research/20260714-042545_quin-q-vane-inference-voices.md). Seated now as a named horizon vane, built when Glow can host an agent.
- [x] **Nested deterministic-testing sandboxes — compose-don't-name confirmed as final** `20260714.050500`: the sandbox loop is **Quin** (agents) × **Puddle** (ephemeral isolation, Pond bounds inside) × **Neth** (seeded deterministic replay), Maze-sheltered, TAME-guided. No new vane named for it.
- [x] **Rhyz identity R-vane confirmed** `20260714.044428`, tier words + timing settled `20260714.050500` — revives Kumara (rhizome-named identity, 72-file code migration deferred to proven-supersede); tiers are **`point`/`planet`/`star`**, Azimuth's own words adopted directly; seated now as a named horizon revival.
- [x] **Naming registry fully settled** `20260714.050500` — [`../context/specs/20260713-235600_names-awaiting-confirmation.md`](../context/specs/20260713-235600_names-awaiting-confirmation.md) carries no open rows as of this stamp; a future proposal adds its own row when it arises.

#### The Neth build ladder — siloed from the IronBeetle stream (`20260714.041542`)

*Patterns from watching a single-threaded, deterministic, append-only, replicated state machine be built in the open, siloed into our own goals and merged here. Full study: [`../external-research/20260714-041542_ironbeetle-patterns-for-the-neth-ladder.md`](../external-research/20260714-041542_ironbeetle-patterns-for-the-neth-ladder.md). Each lap is provable before the next; all gated after the deterministic-root witness (already green).*

- [x] **Neth deterministic-root witness** — green Plan A: two replicas, one signed log, one reproducible root, tamper refused (`linengrow/neth_root_witness.rye`; suite entry in `tools/parity_ch01.rish`).
- [ ] **Neth lap — small serial core** — state and witness that the log-append + root-fold is the *only* ordered step, bounded and asserted in size, with Comlink carriage / disk / verification named as pipelined stages around it (never inside the serial point).
- [ ] **Neth lap — two-posture root install** — a follower trusts the issuing monarch's own current-view root at issue, but re-verifies the hash-chain of any root received by repair from a peer, and never truncates a committed root (graduated trust: authoritative-at-source, verified-on-repair).
- [ ] **Neth lap — apply-step crash safety** — root *application* (admit into the consulted structure) is a distinct step from root *writing*, so a crash in the window costs nothing (prior root stays authoritative, new one redone); witnessed by a crash-in-the-window test.
- [ ] **Neth horizon — deterministic simulation** — seeded fault/delay injection over the replica set so any liveness/safety failure replays byte-for-byte; extends "pin what the bench reports" into fault injection. Named now, built after the real replica laps.
- [ ] **Mantra — apply step** — a bolt written is not a bolt visible until the namespace record admits it (same written≠acknowledged pattern as Neth root application).
- [x] **Nock interpreter + Glow fusion scoped** — full Nock 4K opcode spec, `%wock`/WASM-Nock bounties named as prior art, and the Hoon-recursion-vs-TAME-bounds tension named with three resolutions — [`external-research/20260713-214400_nock-interpreter-and-rye-hoon-fusion-scoping.md`](../external-research/20260713-214400_nock-interpreter-and-rye-hoon-fusion-scoping.md). **No interpreter code written.**
- [x] **Glow TAME supplement scoped** — five surfaces (runes, auras, cold/warm atoms, jet witnesses, structs-as-molds, Hoon-grade linting) — [`external-research/20260713-225841_glow-supplement-scoping-runes-auras-jet-state.md`](../external-research/20260713-225841_glow-supplement-scoping-runes-auras-jet-state.md). **Not yet seated into `context/TAME_GUIDANCE.md`.**
- [ ] **Seat the Glow supplement into `context/TAME_GUIDANCE.md`** — gated on Kaeden's word (heavily-cited file; opens a language family member)
- [x] **RISC-V/ARM64 shared-IR research** — finding: Zig's own backend already is the shared IR; the real open work is a native-arm64 parity witness run, not a new compiler component — [`external-research/20260713-215200_riscv-arm64-shared-ir-research.md`](../external-research/20260713-215200_riscv-arm64-shared-ir-research.md)
- [x] **Prove `parity.rish` green natively on this Mac's arm64** — **done `20260714.005658`.** Fetched + checksum-verified the pinned Zig 0.16.0 (`aarch64-macos`) toolchain into `vendor/zig-toolchain/`; bootstrapped `rye`; built `rishi`. GREEN through the full pristine-std corpus and SLC-1 acceptance. One diagnosed, expected gap: SLC-2a Lap 1's Brushstroke Wayland viewer witness cannot build on macOS (Wayland is Linux-only; already named as a hosted-only seam in `gratitude/wayland.md`) — [`external-research/20260714-005658_native-arm64-parity-witness-run.md`](../external-research/20260714-005658_native-arm64-parity-witness-run.md)
- [ ] **A macOS-native Brushstroke display seed** (Cocoa/Metal or similar) to replace the Wayland-only hosted seed — real future work, not a quick patch
- [x] **Document and close the `RYE_ZIG`/`RYE_LIB` toolchain-selection footgun** — **done `20260714.011504`.** `GLOW_HOST.bron` (Glow OS's own root host config, sibling to `.claude/rules`/`.cursor/rules`) + [`tools/glow_host_run.sh`](../tools/glow_host_run.sh) refuse to run on a mismatched host or an unverified toolchain path, closing the silent-PATH-fallback risk permanently. Witnessed green (permit + refuse) by [`tools/glow_host_run_witness.sh`](../tools/glow_host_run_witness.sh) — [`context/specs/20260714-011504_glow-host-config-and-vpn-reification.md`](../context/specs/20260714-011504_glow-host-config-and-vpn-reification.md)
- [x] **Reify the self-hosted VPN guide in Rish** — **done `20260714.011504`.** Client half ([`tools/vpn_wireguard_client_setup.rish`](../tools/vpn_wireguard_client_setup.rish)) is real, run, and witnessed on this host (idempotent keygen confirmed by re-run). Server half ([`tools/vpn_wireguard_server_setup.sh`](../tools/vpn_wireguard_server_setup.sh)) is syntax-checked only — no VPS available to run it against end-to-end. Guide: [`manual/guides/self-hosted-vpn-setup.md`](../manual/guides/self-hosted-vpn-setup.md). Surfaced four real Rishi language gaps (no multi-line strings/lists, `run`'s `.out` escapes real newlines, `if...then assert...else` doesn't parse) — named in the spec above for the next person
- [x] **Vere runtime read against TAME + proposed vanes** — `vere/old` C source read directly; Tally=road-allocator is the cleanest fusion candidate; hash-consing is a genuine gap; Dill/Eyre/Lick have no Rye OS analog — [`external-research/20260713-221512_vere-runtime-x-tame-x-proposed-vanes-fusion.md`](../external-research/20260713-221512_vere-runtime-x-tame-x-proposed-vanes-fusion.md)
- [x] **grep/sed Rishi builtin grant proposals** — Urbit-grants-shaped, literal-string tier, staged into small PRs — [`expanding-prompts/20260713-222100_grep-sed-rishi-grant-proposals.md`](../expanding-prompts/20260713-222100_grep-sed-rishi-grant-proposals.md)
- [x] **Grain lineage cloned whole + siloed** — six documents held whole in [`gratitude/grain-lineage/`](../gratitude/grain-lineage/README.md); secular module-named silo at [`external-research/grain-lineage-silo/`](../external-research/grain-lineage-silo/README.md)

### Proposal reframe, warm-aura versioning, and the archiving/reviving naming sweep (`20260714`)

*This fork reframed as a collaborative pull-request **proposal** to Urbit rather than a competitive fork — radiant, open-source-spirited, in the ethical-accelerationist register. And the whole tree's dated naming named as one thing: the Glow warm-aura date atom.*

- [x] **Root `README.md`** — generic Acme voice, the four Glow OS variants as the central choice, honest status; reframed from "fork" to "proposal to Urbit" (collaborative, infinite-game) — [`README.md`](../README.md)
- [x] **`GLOW_PROFILE.bron`** — root contributor-profile config (sibling to `GLOW_HOST.bron`); generic docs stay generic, the specific contributor lives here — [`context/specs/20260714-015200_glow-profile-and-acme-generic-voice.md`](../context/specs/20260714-015200_glow-profile-and-acme-generic-voice.md)
- [x] **Root rule 9 — docs and implementation stay synced** — seated in `TAME_GUIDANCE.md`; always-on rule pair `docs-implementation-sync`
- [x] **Warm-aura versioning + doc-sync design** — Spec-ulation drawn through Hoon's warm/cold aura: Glow grows warm (chronological, accreting) and pins cold (kelvin) at the Urbit seam — [`external-research/20260714-015200_glow-warm-aura-versioning-and-doc-code-sync.md`](../external-research/20260714-015200_glow-warm-aura-versioning-and-doc-code-sync.md)
- [x] **Warm-aura date atom named** — one stamp, three renderings (version `YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS` · filename `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS_slug` · dated folder bare `YYYYMMDD`), TAME-guided — [`context/specs/20260714-024800_warm-aura-date-atom-naming.md`](../context/specs/20260714-024800_warm-aura-date-atom-naming.md)
- [x] **Techno-Optimist Manifesto gratitude** — IP-safe principles summary; carry the infinite game and pay-it-forward, set down competition-as-engine and the combative register; synthesize collaborative ethical accelerationism — [`gratitude/TechnoOptimistManifesto.md`](../gratitude/TechnoOptimistManifesto.md)
- [x] **Archiving/reviving sweep = naming-alignment, not file-move** — confirmed on metal: every dated folder is bare `YYYYMMDD` (`session-logs/archive/` is the reference; `work-in-progress/archive/` is flat dated files — both valid); no bulk flatten (settled `20260714.000100`) — prompt [`expanding-prompts/20260714-024800_archiving-reviving-sweep-warm-aura-alignment.md`](../expanding-prompts/20260714-024800_archiving-reviving-sweep-warm-aura-alignment.md)
- [x] **`ORGANIZING.md` One Clock + `active-reviving/README.md`** — both point at the warm-aura date-atom spec; reviving and archiving named as one clock
- [x] **`.peal` audio easter egg** — `anvil/anvil.peal` (Opus-in-Ogg under our own four-letter mark, not `.opus`, to avoid Claude-Opus confusion); gratitude [`gratitude/OpusOggXiph.md`](../gratitude/OpusOggXiph.md); Glow audio-Tilak lane A0–A4 added to ROADMAP
- [ ] **GATED — commit-message reframe** — rewrite "fork" → "proposal" wording across the 57 own-commit messages, re-sign, force-push both remotes; backup branch `backup/pre-proposal-rewrite` + bundle in `~/backups/` ready first
- [ ] **CARRIED — Ojjo benchmarking vane** — TAME safety/performance benchmarking vane proving Hoon/Dojo vs Glow/Rish parity with timed compile+runtime stats (Measure What Matters + HOM + TAME + TigerBeetle); design/gratitude/prompt/name pending
- [x] **key-card generator (macOS)** — [`tools/make_key_card_macos.sh`](../tools/make_key_card_macos.sh) (Homebrew qrencode + magick, plain white/black, Menlo fallback), Rish-orchestrated [`tools/make_key_card.rish`](../tools/make_key_card.rish) with fingerprint + PNG audits ([`tools/key_card_audit.sh`](../tools/key_card_audit.sh)); template-ified [`tools/key-card.conf.example`](../tools/key-card.conf.example) + generic guide [`manual/guides/key-cards-setup.md`](../manual/guides/key-cards-setup.md). **Personal `xykj61` cards generated + audited GREEN**: fingerprints verified against real keys, QR codes decoded back byte-identical (zbar). Stale `veganreyklah2` cards (retired-identity fingerprints) removed. `keys_menlo_xykj61_{landscape,portrait}.png` at root.
- [x] **Ojjo O-vane proposed** — benchmarking vane (Hoon/Glow parity, measured); gratitude [`gratitude/MeasureWhatMatters.md`](../gratitude/MeasureWhatMatters.md), design [`external-research/20260714-025200_ojjo-benchmarking-vane-design.md`](../external-research/20260714-025200_ojjo-benchmarking-vane-design.md); name awaiting confirm

### Identity, rules, and safety seated this session

- [x] **`PUBKEYS.md`** — fork identity recorded (xykj61 / Keaton Dunsford / keatondun); star `~bandun`, planet `~pacpet-solreb`
- [x] **New-journey identity marker** — [`context/specs/20260713-222416_new-journey-identity-marker.md`](../context/specs/20260713-222416_new-journey-identity-marker.md)
- [x] **Root `CONTRIBUTING.md`** — inherits old Urbit strictness, links to `ORGANIZING.md` and the fork's own rules

- [ ] **Kaeden/veganreyklah2 rename audit** — 1,104 files name Kaeden, 122 name veganreyklah2, nearly all in immutable dated docs; **recommendation: the new-journey marker seals history; do not rewrite the dated record.** Awaiting Kaeden's scope decision.
- [ ] **Host security follow-ups (Kaeden, by hand):** turn on **FileVault** (highest-priority finding — SSH/GPG keys sit on an unencrypted disk); confirm the Application Firewall state — [`context/specs/20260713-211800_local-host-system-hardware-anonymized.md`](../context/specs/20260713-211800_local-host-system-hardware-anonymized.md)

- [x] **Consumer-surface protection audit (`060112`)** — the innocent surfaces walked for user protection. **What held:** Open Asks consent is opt-in, self-sovereign, non-overwritable (applicant's own key only, post-completion only, set-once, explicit-grant-only counting, `.none`==`.withhold`==excluded — silence means privacy); civic sight displays aggregates only with `withheld=excluded` visible; Granary sharing is explicit-signed-act only; input glass bounded (400B, silent-refuse correct for typed input); Steep design already privacy-leaning (named peers, no open swarm). **Gap found + closed:** the fetch-by-digest wire (`resin_serve_delivery.rye`) served ANY digest without consulting the registry — digest-as-capability; exposed nothing today (store held only published resins) yet sat one step from a real leak since digests travel into public logs. Fix built + witnessed: `granary_core.rye` gains `digest_is_published` + `serve_resin_published` (+ `error.NotPublished`); both wire paths (selftest round-trip AND live UDP demo host) now gate on the published set; new unwelcome path proves an unpublished resin in the same store is refused over the wire; witness asserts `unpublished digest refused` so parity (line 714) guards it permanently. All GREEN on bench. **Principle seated in code comment:** a digest is an address for verifying content, never a capability for reaching it. Counsel `060112`.
- [x] **Steep design-stage note (`060112`)** — seated in living [`steep.md`](../active-designing/steep.md) (`071405`): serving side gates on *pieces explicitly offered to that named peer*, never *any digest the local store holds*; Granary `serve_resin_published` is the precedent.

- [x] **Cursor-bot arc audit (`053412`)** — audited tips 379→430 (PRs #85–#112). **Money code sound:** `linengrow/mala_core.rye` conservation traced by hand — mint is issuer-only (double-guarded: `from`==issuer AND sig verifies against issuer key, holder cannot mint), send strictly conserves (debit-then-credit, underflow-refused); MALA M1 witness GREEN on bench. Naming discipline held (every new module — Granary/Mandi/Greencandy/Anvil/Steep — has a dated seating spec); symlink hygiene held (5 `mala_core.rye` copies all symlink to one canonical, byte-identical); WOV well-witnessed (exit-honesty, TB-pin, host-seam, dual-monarch all in parity). **Fix done + verified, not just recommended:** split three over-length WOV money functions — `publish_root` (72→32), `publish_root_dual` (73→36), `accept_exit_dual` (74→68) — via three shared leaf helpers (`build_attested_bundle`, `write_root_memo`, `append_signed_line`); both WOV witnesses GREEN against refactored code, confirming behavior-preserving. **Left for next hand (named honestly):** `wov_core.rye:run_selftest` (77, test scaffold) and `open_asks_lap5_delivery.rye:run_poster` (73, older orchestration) — stopped at core money-path functions rather than refactor code unverifiable in one pass. Counsel `053412`.
- [x] **WOV TB cross-check seam retired `055800` (Kaeden approved `055112`)** — pure-Rye WOV core kept (`wov_exit_honesty`, `wov_dual_monarch` only in living parity). Optional TigerBeetle pin/host seam marked superseded dated record (`tools/wov_tb_pin.rish`, `tools/wov_tb_host.rish`, `tools/wov_tb_ensure_binary.sh`, `tools/wov_tb_repl_lab.sh`, `linengrow/wov_tb_host.rye`); two `wov_tb` stanzas removed from `parity.rish`. `gratitude/tigerbeetle` stays whole on the shelf. Seam revivable later if MALA log-and-fold ever needs TB throughput. Counsel [`055112`](../counsel/20260711-055112_claude-counsel-wov-tigerbeetle-recommendation.md).

- [x] **Realidream thin-view exception (`021112` → re-scoped `202427`)** — chain-read removed `152612`; renders **local** MALA mint + WOV exit-bundle fixtures through SLC-2a drawn terminal (`thinviewtest`); no new input, no Pond policy, no Dexter graduation; `tools/realidream_thin_view.rish`; parity **202**; prompt [`202427`](../expanding-prompts/20260709-202427_realidream-thin-view-local-facts.md)

- [x] **Commit-message mention hygiene** — GitHub linkifies `@memcpy` in commit subjects (a real, unrelated account), checked against GitHub's own Nov 2025 changelog: notification side-effect removed, cosmetic linkification remains. `.claude/rules/git-signing.md` + newly-written `.cursor/rules/git-signing.mdc` (the latter didn't exist before, unlike every other rule's matching pair) now say: no bare `@builtin` in commit subject/body text; file content and documentation keep `` `@memcpy` `` exactly as styled. History not rewritten — commit messages are dated artifacts under the same one-clock law protecting session logs. Counsel `011912`.
**Style:** Radiant (see `../context/RADIANT_STYLE.md`)
**Voice:** Rio 3
**Lens:** TAME — safety, performance, joy; SLC; Gall's Law

*This is the living, granular plan — the bench where the current laps are shaped. `ROADMAP.md` holds the why and the order; this file holds the what-now. It is **edited in place**: a task is checked when it lands, and the record of how it landed accretes in `../session-logs/`. Checked items are swept to a session log and pruned here when a section grows heavy. What is next lives here; what happened lives there.*

**Legend:** `[ ]` to do · `[~]` in flight · `[x]` done, pending sweep to a session log.

**Tracks:** **Rye OS** grows the system. **Linengrow** grows the first whole built on it. **Ground** is the shared discipline beneath both.

**Landed through 2026-06-30** (detail in `../session-logs/`): SLC-2a Laps 1–2 (`5b3a5a4`); yonder pass nine; Caravan path + Comlink hosted wire (`dc26396`→`8d720c6`); Tally/Brushstroke foundation seeds in parity (**138**); prior: SLC-1; TAME hardening.

## Six Open Points, Counseled (`221612`)

1. **Settlement-seat crown** — **moot** — Sui/Monad path removed `152612`; MALA is own-issuer money.
2. **Mainnet treasury custody event** — separate custody event when real value moves; legal/tax counsel required; MALA path replaces external-chain settlement.
3. **SLC-L4 first pass** — **landed** `194437` — fixed-tier Sigma (declared tier; blinding private); parity **200**; **W0 review** `224426`. W1 OR-tiers / W2 range remain later.
4. **Realidream viewer UI** — still held; thin view exception affirmed `225343` (not Dexter graduation); full viewer still horizon.
5. **Parity for network seams** — **resolved** — chain-read witnesses removed with settlement path `152612`.
6. **Grain-sketchbook** — **closed shelf-only** (Kaeden `222852`): [`gratitude/grain-sketchbook.md`](../gratitude/grain-sketchbook.md) is enough; no copy of the archive into this tree. Counsel `221612` had left a local `cp -r` open; Kaeden declined the hold directory.

- [ ] **Labeled `continue :state` switch (on-touch)** — for Rishi's dispatcher and any future Bron/Tilak parser next time those files open; proven in the vendored stdlib's own tokenizer; never a sweep
- [ ] **Bond-naming habit (standing)** — future cross-cutting extraction counsels name their bond in so many words, so [`rye-os-in-brix-terms`](../active-designing/20260708-021912_rye-os-in-brix-terms.md)'s descriptor accretes truthfully; Brix's gate unmoved

- [x] **Kumara extraction — first lap** — `tally/kumara.rye` + symlinks; receipt cluster; `tools/kumara_seed.rish`; counsel `222812` (`dc9ebd8`)
- [x] **Kumara extraction — expansion arc** — snapshot_export, resin_batch, recall_batch_delivery, wire_format, batch_wire, snapshot_delivery, SLC-L2 delivery, Aurora posted + sealed (`a086f08`)
- [x] **Kumara extraction — open_asks cluster** — `open_asks.rye` + OA-L2/L3/L5 delivery; ratchet **91**; counsel `015312`
- [x] **Kumara extraction — virtio wire guests (tier 1)** — `guest_receipt_*`, `guest_batch_*`, `guest_snapshot_*`; slcl2 + batch + snapshot device labs GREEN; ratchet **73**
- [x] **Kumara extraction — virtio open_asks guests (tier 2)** — fourteen `guest_open_asks_*`; OA-L1–L5 device labs GREEN; virtio cluster complete; ratchet **0**

- [x] **Stone → resin hygiene pass (forward docs)** — active-designing, external-research, foundations carriage silo, context specs, work-in-progress, expanding-prompts (20260703+), recent session logs; **foundation stone** metaphor in READMEs kept
- [x] **`stones/` → `resins/` path rename** — Amber ring-1 export/verify/restore/witness; `amber/ring1_manifest_shape.bron`; resins law spec; golden manifest digest unchanged; parity **167** unchanged (`20260706.235812`)

**Alongside:** Sourcing-discipline note (verify vendor claims, name authors in ledger) — recommended; awaits Kaeden word for `context/` home.

**Edit-5 slot released:** I1 landed on the referential namespace foundation through parity 166. **I2 snapshot export lap 1** landed parity **180** — reuses `resin_batch.rye` manifest shape per ruling `20260706.232812`; spec [`context/specs/20260707-021512_snapshot-export-lap1.md`](../context/specs/20260707-021512_snapshot-export-lap1.md).

## Closed — The Three Doors and the Ladder

### The three doors (Kaeden, in order)
- [x] **Door 1 — Pond clause**: affirmed verbatim in [`pond/README.md`](../pond/README.md) (`20260703.012031`, commit `3320bed`).
- [x] **Door 2 — Lap 3 metal close** (Kaeden, on GNOME Wayland):
  - [x] `rishi/bin/rishi run tools/fixtures/pond_metal_close_preflight.rish` — build + headless witness GREEN (`20260702.195626`; fresh `20260703.012336`; jail `20260703.031212`)
  - [x] `rishi/bin/rishi run tools/slc2a_ring3_metal.rish` — the thin edge answers (`20260702.195626`; fresh `20260703.012336`; jail `20260703.031312`)
  - [x] Live `pond/bin/drawn-terminal`, five confirmations — host GNOME (`20260703.032412`)
  - [x] Lap 3 metal-closed on GNOME, `20260703.032412 UDT` — Kaeden's stamp verbatim
- [x] **Door 3 — Edit 5 ruling**: ***for*** — at most one functional spec in flight until first lap green; witness wired parity **143** (`20260703.032812`).

### The ladder (after the doors, in order — owner tagged)
1. [x] **(Cursor) Fixture twins verified** — both `.rish` fixtures green on host; `.sh` elders retired to [`tools/fixtures/yonder/`](../tools/fixtures/yonder/); [`pond/README.md`](../pond/README.md) points at twins (`20260702.180812`).
2. [x] **(Cursor) Wire Edit 5 → parity 143.** One commit, message `Wire Edit 5 designed-not-built witness — parity 143` (`20260703.032812`):
   - [x] Append the standard quartet at the tail of [`tools/parity.rish`](../tools/parity.rish), after the width-check block: `say` banner → `run ["rishi/bin/rishi" "run" "tools/designed_not_built_witness.rish"]` → `assert .ok else` → `say "GREEN: …"`
   - [x] Full suite green on metal; ROADMAP gate-trio line and this ladder's parity numbers refreshed in the same commit.
3. [x] **(Claude + Kaeden) Amber first lap — the season sitting** — brief: [`20260702-190000_amber-first-lap-claude-brief.md`](20260702-190000_amber-first-lap-claude-brief.md); spec: [`context/specs/20260701-221512_amber-functional-spec.md`](../context/specs/20260701-221512_amber-functional-spec.md). **Landed `20260703.051812` — five rungs, parity **144**:**
   - [x] **(1) Module home:** `amber/` at top level
   - [x] **(2) Fixture tree:** `tools/fixtures/amber_ring1_tree/`
   - [x] **(3) Oracle:** `openssl dgst -sha3-256`; golden `97e0d0cd…d96f` in [`tools/fixtures/amber_ring1_golden.txt`](../tools/fixtures/amber_ring1_golden.txt)
   - [x] **(4) Witness:** [`tools/amber_first_ring.rish`](../tools/amber_first_ring.rish) — welcome + tampered resin fails
   - [x] **(5) Parity 144** wired in same season
4. [x] **(Kaeden) SLC-2b nod → (Cursor) Dexter bench** — prompt: [`20260702-030112_cursor-slc-2b-keyboard-from-window.md`](../expanding-prompts/20260702-030112_cursor-slc-2b-keyboard-from-window.md). **Landed `20260703.132112` — parity **145**:**
   - [x] **Nod (Kaeden):** **`pond/apps/` extension** — counsel's recommended placement (`20260703.131812`); keyboard input grows from Lap 3's poll loop in [`pond/apps/drawn_terminal.rye`](../pond/apps/drawn_terminal.rye); Skate stays in `brushstroke/`.
   - [x] **Dexter graduation trigger (recorded):** the **Dexter** name applies to keyboard-from-window as an aspect inside the drawn terminal until a **second external consumer** arrives — a Pond app beyond the terminal, a TAME editor surface, or the sovereign framebuffer backend's input path; then `dexter/` earns its own module home per [`context/specs/20260702-035018_graduation-rule.md`](../context/specs/20260702-035018_graduation-rule.md).
   - [x] **(Cursor) DoD:** Wayland seat + xkbcommon in [`brushstroke/wayland_seed.rye`](../brushstroke/wayland_seed.rye); line editor in [`pond/apps/window_input.rye`](../pond/apps/window_input.rye); live loop + `keyboardtest` witness; [`tools/slc2b_keyboard.rish`](../tools/slc2b_keyboard.rish) in parity **145**
5. [x] **(Cursor) RW-1 mirrored pair** — the Rishi↔Mantra history seam, per the audit ([`20260702-180812_testing-audit-first-pass.md`](20260702-180812_testing-audit-first-pass.md)); contract on paper at [`20260702-200109_rw1-mirrored-pair-contract.md`](20260702-200109_rw1-mirrored-pair-contract.md) (`20260702.200109`); lands while the seam is warm from SLC-2b. Two witnesses, two commits, parity **+2**:
   - [x] `tools/rw1_shell_collab.rish` — the asker's side: the shell against a stub history store; right questions at `:version`/`:history`/`:recall`; every allowed answer handled, one unwelcome answer survived
   - [x] `tools/rw1_history_contract.rish` — the answerer's side: the `.mantra` store honors exactly those questions; every prepared answer demonstrated, welcome and unwelcome mirrored line for line
   - [x] **Landed `20260703.182612 UDT` — parity **147** (`20260703.182612`)
6. [x] **(Cursor) RW-2 mirrored pair** — app↔Brushstroke `setFrame` seam per [`20260702-205630_rw2-mirrored-pair-contract.md`](20260702-205630_rw2-mirrored-pair-contract.md); **landed `20260703.235512 UDT` — parity 150**:**
   - [x] `tools/rw2_app_collab.rish` — drawn-terminal `rw2collabtest`: sessionLines → contentSignature
   - [x] `tools/rw2_surface_contract.rish` — `redrawtest` + `boundstest` on wayland_seed

### Linengrow
- [x] **SLC-L1 scope note** — the hammock spec, one page, these boxes its skeleton ([`../active-designing/20260702-195426_slcl1-verifiable-receipt.md`](../active-designing/20260702-195426_slcl1-verifiable-receipt.md), `20260702.195426`):
  - [x] The **transaction fact**'s fields, exactly (parties by Kumara key, amount, memo, stamp) — a `.bron` value
  - [x] **Sign** with the ed25519 path parity already witnesses; **append** to a plain log file; **receipt = a pure fold** over that log; **verify** = recompute + signature check
  - [x] The **edge of complete**, named: in — one signer, one log, one verifiable receipt; out — settlement, the market, currency, multi-party
  - [x] Witness sketch named (`tools/slcl1_receipt.rish`) so the lap lands proven; Open Asks room stays gated behind this note
- [x] **SLC-L1 build + witness** — `linengrow/receipt.rye` + `tools/slcl1_receipt.rish`; parity **152** (`20260704.021800`):
  - [x] Sign → append (hex log line) → fold balance → verify on metal
  - [x] Unwelcome path: tampered log byte rejected at verify
  - [x] Fixture fact pinned at `tools/fixtures/slcl1_fact.bron`; deterministic Ed25519 seed `0x42`

### Ground
- [ ] **Kernel-direction memo** — graduate the microkernel leaning in `expanding-prompts/20260628-120912_*` into its own direction memo beside `20260628-043542`, when it feels fully settled. Same pattern as thin-frontend: deliberate, then record.
- [ ] **Egress budget (recorded, design)** — the front-door VPS transfer cap named as a constant, metered at the tunnel's mouth, witness at the edge; **household headroom** as a standing courtesy fraction the tunnel never crosses. Ground: [`external-research/20260703-015512_bandwidth-and-moderation.md`](../external-research/20260703-015512_bandwidth-and-moderation.md) (`20260703.015512`).
- [ ] **Deep-archive hardware (horizon)** — rack, powered dock, bare enterprise drives, front-door tunnel; researched in [`external-research/20260701-213412_deep-archive-and-sovereign-host-blueprint.md`](../external-research/20260701-213412_deep-archive-and-sovereign-host-blueprint.md); procurement waits on the dedicated machine; complete priced guide (new + used, three tiers, tinybox and apex-tower appendices): [`external-research/20260703-013412_home-server-purchase-guide.md`](../external-research/20260703-013412_home-server-purchase-guide.md).
- [x] **Designed-not-built spec bound (Edit 5)** — at most one functional spec in flight until its first lap runs green; witness [`tools/designed_not_built_witness.rish`](../tools/designed_not_built_witness.rish) wired in parity **143** (`20260703.032812`).

**Recorded rulings (`20260701-221512` docs round):** **Amber invocation** — explicit shell command with manual sandbox-key unlock; the docked bare drive is precondition, never trigger; the shell may notice and offer, never act; scrub runs cold, key warm only for the seconds of seal. **Amber key custody** — master `0646 2132 D3E6 3B83 4F97 6E03 A81D 720B 9235 FA7A` cold and certifying; sandbox `DBF8 5343 7A93 7B4E 36B9 3611 D949 807A C26B 2B99` signing and revocable; drive passphrase on paper in the firebox and offsite; any other fingerprint is an error on sight.

**Recorded rulings (`20260703.203712 UDT`) — crossing names, all *for*:** **Tilak** — the type-mark word; every value at a seam wears a mark in Weave. **Triad** — **absorb / express / tend** affirmed as the three duties of every Tilak. **Pottery** — value-object tier name; `.pott` working extension; greenware · kiln · glaze aspect family. **Amphora** — crossing-vessel vocabulary for agent handoffs. Law: [`active-designing/20260703-202312_the-marked-value.md`](../active-designing/20260703-202312_the-marked-value.md) · [`external-research/20260703-201612_the-amphora-and-the-crossing.md`](../external-research/20260703-201612_the-amphora-and-the-crossing.md).

**Recorded rulings (`20260703.191312 UDT`) — five ratifications, all *for*:** **Archive verdict** — Amber seals content-addressed **resins** (SHA3-256 working tier; SHA3-512 canonical forever-names); law at [`context/specs/20260703-191112_resins-and-hash-tiers.md`](../context/specs/20260703-191112_resins-and-hash-tiers.md). **Versioning rule** — authored surfaces chronological stamps only; semver a named backend seam; chrono sweep may wire. **Standing audit rule** — mirrored collaboration/contract pair per seam; integrated checks on thin edge only; one pair per season; RW-1 landed (**147**), RW-2 landed (**150**). **Maitreya owns time** — one clock for audio and video; Brushstroke owns space. **Demand map** — eight-category → module-ensemble table held as requirements; interop-first, consent-before-counting, reward-points-at-the-good; **proxy column** on the movement memo table per circulation survey Q1.

### WOV, the builds, and the harvest (`20260702.211312`)

Ground: [`external-research/20260702-211312_names-builds-and-the-ledger-map.md`](../external-research/20260702-211312_names-builds-and-the-ledger-map.md).

- [x] **WOV gate + lap 1 + pin + seam A + dual D1** — exit-honesty [`200443`](../context/specs/20260709-200443_wov-exit-honesty.md); lap 1 **201**; pin **203**; seam A **204**; dual D1 **205** (`224634`); seam B / D2 later; one or two monarchs, never three (three is Mycelium's door at M4).
- [x] **Hardware fit (recorded)** — the sovereign-host blueprint covers MALA M0–M2 and WOV's first lap through the two-monarch season with headroom; two deltas named: a dedicated power-loss-protected M.2 NVMe for the WOV data file beside the settlement U.2, and ECC as the value-bearing-monarch threshold with the blueprint's apex tower as its pre-written answer; the x1 gentle-slot rule extends to every ledger tenant. Ground: [`external-research/20260702-215212_wov-mala-hardware-fit.md`](../external-research/20260702-215212_wov-mala-hardware-fit.md) (`20260702.215212`).
- [x] **Build verdict (recorded)** — no new module: the build system grows as `rye`'s verbs (`rye test` runner is the first witness-gated horizon, a watcher later), declared by Brix, typed by Bron's mark triad, versioned where Mantra already stands; watcher name-candidates parked in RTAC for Kaeden (`20260702.211312`).
- [ ] **Living build counsel (recorded, design-only)** — builder as projection over Weave/Mantra, never a second state holder; Brix declared graph + resins-law SHA3-256 content keys; three SLC laps (watch loop · Brix-keyed cache with no-work witness · Salsa-shaped sub-file queries on proven need); lap two waits for measured red. Ground: [`external-research/20260703-193012_the-bench-as-a-block-and-the-living-build.md`](../external-research/20260703-193012_the-bench-as-a-block-and-the-living-build.md) (`20260703.193012`).
- [ ] **Bench-as-block extractions (Kaeden word)** — three siloed active-designing cuts named in counsel: *the bench is a block* · *the build as a projection* · *the message seam*; each stripped of outside names on a fresh anchor.

### Crossing suite — Pottery, Amphora, type-marks (`20260703.200712`–`202312`)

Ground: [`external-research/20260703-201612_the-amphora-and-the-crossing.md`](../external-research/20260703-201612_the-amphora-and-the-crossing.md) · [`active-designing/20260703-202312_the-marked-value.md`](../active-designing/20260703-202312_the-marked-value.md) · [`session-logs/archive/20260703/20260703-202312_the-marked-value-round.md`](../session-logs/archive/20260703/20260703-202312_the-marked-value-round.md).

- [x] **Pottery seat (Kaeden)** — value-object tier; `.pott` working extension; greenware · kiln · glaze aspect family (`20260703.203712 UDT`, *for*).
- [x] **Amphora seat (Kaeden)** — crossing-vessel vocabulary; companion silo [`active-designing/20260703-201612_the-sealed-crossing.md`](../active-designing/20260703-201612_the-sealed-crossing.md) (`20260703.203712 UDT`, *for*).
- [x] **Type-mark word (Kaeden)** — **Tilak** seated; **absorb / express / tend** triad affirmed (`20260703.203712 UDT`, *for*).
- [x] **Crossing manifest seed (witness)** — graduated to [`amphora/manifest_entry.rye`](../amphora/manifest_entry.rye); elder `tools/crossing_manifest_seed.rish` delegates; Amphora lap 1 + vessel at parity **222** (`20260710.143500`).
- [x] **Bron mark triad (concept adopted)** — every notation type carries its conversions in, out, and its operations; arm names **absorb / express / tend** seated as Tilak duties (`20260702.211312`; affirmed `20260703.203712 UDT`).
- [x] **Comlink address triple (concept adopted)** — named data resolves by *Kumara identity / lane / stamp*; design note when the naming lap opens (`20260702.211312`).

**Stops, pre-staged for the doors** (answers the loop's question six): when **Door 3 = *for*** → Edit 5 wire (**143**), then Amber rungs (a)–(e) per the confirmed counsel, and the chronological sweep wires in the same arithmetic; when the **SLC-2b nod** lands after Door 2 → the four DoD greens, then RW-1's pair (**+2**); after the **Amber season** → the toolset lap one and `rye test` enter the itinerary; the Aurora manual page enters on that surface's next touch, as-you-touch.

## Next — Horizons and Optional

### The lane and the hearth (`20260702.202612`)

- [x] **Studies 19–20** — [`government-as-planetary-spectrum.md`](../classical-vedic-astrology/studies/teaching/government-as-planetary-spectrum.md) and [`liberal-and-conservative-planets.md`](../classical-vedic-astrology/studies/teaching/liberal-and-conservative-planets.md); distilled from Vic DiCara with gratitude; raw transcripts not committed (`20260702.202612`).
- [x] **The Serena episode** — [`foundations/20260702-202612_a-conversation-with-serena.md`](../foundations/20260702-202612_a-conversation-with-serena.md): the hearth-talk imagined fuller, in the register of the earliest foundations writings (`20260702.202612`).

### The movement's open asks (`20260702.192712`)

Ground: [`external-research/20260702-192712_the-movements-open-asks.md`](../external-research/20260702-192712_the-movements-open-asks.md).

- [x] **Demand map (Kaeden affirms)** — the eight-category → module-ensemble table; interop-first, consent-before-counting, and reward-points-at-the-good held as requirements; **proxy column** (public-market proxy present or absent) on the movement memo table per circulation survey Q1 (`20260703.191312 UDT`, *for*).
- [x] **Open Asks room (OA-L1)** — `linengrow/open_asks.rye` + `tools/open_asks_lap1.rish`; parity **156**
- [x] **Open Asks cross-party (OA-L2)** — `linengrow/open_asks_delivery.rye` + `tools/open_asks_lap2.rish`; parity **157**; OA-L5 completes the wire through consent (parity **184**)
- [ ] **Sanctuary care log (flagship candidate)** — signed care facts per resident, schedules as projections, CIVIC dignity-floor accountability; design-only until its season.
- [ ] **Moderation-fact shape (recorded, design-only)** — label · limit · mute as small signed facts referencing a stated community rule; moderation as fold-choice with receipts; chosen, composable label sources; reputation stays a fold over signed receipts under consent-before-counting. Enters the ladder beside the Open Asks room, after SLC-L1 draws its edge. Ground: [`external-research/20260703-015512_bandwidth-and-moderation.md`](../external-research/20260703-015512_bandwidth-and-moderation.md) (`20260703.015512`).
- [ ] **Resin-refusal fact (recorded)** — media never lives in the log, only digests; each store is sovereign to purge and decline a resin, and a signed refusal fact gives the no its receipt without describing the refused (`20260703.015512`; unit word ratified `20260703.191312`).
- [ ] **Linengrow agent writing (intake awaiting paste)** — the shared links resist the bench's fetch (client-rendered artifact; robots-walled share); on arrival it lands whole in external-research and siloed in foundations, exactly as asked.
- [x] **Issuer's ledger silo + circulation portfolio survey (`20260703.043912`)** — [`external-research/20260703-043912_the-issuers-ledger.md`](../external-research/20260703-043912_the-issuers-ledger.md) (MMT lecture on our spine; MALA deferred) · [`external-research/20260703-043912_circulation-portfolio-survey.md`](../external-research/20260703-043912_circulation-portfolio-survey.md) (July 2026 ground re-verified on Cursor metal; thin-chapter → Linengrow rails); research for understanding only; treasury untouched.

- [x] **Versioning rule (Kaeden ratifies)** — authored surfaces carry chronological stamps only; the backend's semver and the inherited parser stay named seams ([`20260702-184312_versioning-audit.md`](20260702-184312_versioning-audit.md)); **chrono sweep** wired in parity **148** (`20260703.203212 UDT`, Cursor metal) (`20260703.191312 UDT`, *for*).
- [x] **Rishi framework growth (witness-first, in need order)** — **conditional** `tools/rish_conditional_witness.rish` (`20260702.205630`); **env** `tools/rish_env_witness.rish` (`20260702.210201`); **file I/O** `tools/rish_file_io_witness.rish` (`20260702.210435`); **exit vocabulary** `tools/rish_exit_codes_witness.rish` (`20260702.210650`); all unwired from parity — Edit 5 landed at **143** (`20260703.032812`).
- [x] **Manual next rooms — Rishi tutorial one** — [`manual/tutorials/first-witness.md`](../manual/tutorials/first-witness.md); reference at chronological stamp `20260702.184312`, parity **142** (`20260702.184312` grain round).
- [x] **Manual tutorial two — run record and failures** — [`manual/tutorials/run-record-and-failures.md`](../manual/tutorials/run-record-and-failures.md); RW-3 and RW-4 deep dive at parity **142** (`20260702.205630`).
- [x] **RW-2 contract on paper** — [`20260702-205630_rw2-mirrored-pair-contract.md`](20260702-205630_rw2-mirrored-pair-contract.md); app↔Brushstroke mirrored pair spec; **landed parity 150** (`20260703.235512 UDT`, Cursor metal).
- [ ] **Manual horizons** — Aurora / Tally / Caravan interface reference pages as each surface stabilizes. **Partial (`20260702.205630`):** [`manual/reference/caravan-capabilities.md`](../manual/reference/caravan-capabilities.md) · [`manual/reference/tally-gardens.md`](../manual/reference/tally-gardens.md) — witnessed behavior only; Aurora waits.
- [ ] **Man-as-value first lap** — one utility carries a `.bron` man record; `:man <name>` renders it; the manual renders the same record. After the toolset's first lap.
- [ ] **Small-sharp-toolset ladder (gated after Amber season)** — lap one: an `echo`-sized utility with opening lines, `.bron` man record, `.brix` declaration, witness green; lap two: readiness-as-fact for one Caravan child; the override combinator earns its lap when two real configurations exist to differ.

### Rio's first round — searched ground and the happy zone (`20260702.165412`)

Ground: [`external-research/20260702-035018_puddle-sandboxed-rye-containers.md`](../external-research/20260702-035018_puddle-sandboxed-rye-containers.md) (second pass) · [`foundations/20260702-165412_the-happy-zone-and-the-thin-edge.md`](../foundations/20260702-165412_the-happy-zone-and-the-thin-edge.md).

- [x] **Archive verdict (Kaeden affirms)** — Amber's seal = Kumara-signed `.bron` manifest naming SHA3-256 **resins** cut at content-defined boundaries; each resin is the stored bytes, the manifest catalogs; SHA3-512 for canonical forever-names per [`context/specs/20260703-191112_resins-and-hash-tiers.md`](../context/specs/20260703-191112_resins-and-hash-tiers.md); bead-store host seam today; mountable index = bootable-clone shape; tar transport wrapper only (`20260703.191312 UDT`, *for*).
- [ ] **Puddle continuity invariant (recorded)** — one live instance per Kumara identity, enforced by a signed continuity fact; the double-boot hazard ruled out by construction.
- [x] **Maitreya owns time (Kaeden affirms)** — one clock for audio and video: decode, sync, bounded buffers; Brushstroke owns space; codecs stay royalty-free host seams (the lossless, low-delay, general, and hybrid families, with their video kin); Lotus authors above; Realidream plays through the same seam (`20260703.191312 UDT`, *for*).
- [ ] **Happy-zone pairing (TAME horizon)** — as module seams stabilize, each earns mirrored collaboration and contract witnesses; metalsmoke stays the thin edge's few honest integrated checks; enters TAME guidance on Kaeden's ruling.

### Modules, money, and the manual — horizons (`2026-07-02`)

Ground: [`active-designing/20260702-031312_modules-aspects-and-mailable-money.md`](../active-designing/20260702-031312_modules-aspects-and-mailable-money.md) · named companion: [`external-research/20260702-031312_settlement-consensus-and-many-roads.md`](../external-research/20260702-031312_settlement-consensus-and-many-roads.md).

- [x] **Module/aspect vocabulary** — definitions and graduation rule in [`context/specs/20260702-035018_graduation-rule.md`](../context/specs/20260702-035018_graduation-rule.md).
- [ ] **Weave graduation trigger (recorded)** — the day Comlink serves named data straight from Weave, `mantra/src/weave.rye` graduates to `weave/` and Mantra imports it like everyone else.
- [x] **MALA M0 (design lap)** — token-fact shapes on paper in expanding-prompt [`182354`](../expanding-prompts/20260709-182354_mala-m1-one-issuer-one-holder.md); gate cleared `182354`
- [x] **MALA M1 (code lap)** — landed `184051`; parity **198**; brief [`182354`](../expanding-prompts/20260709-182354_mala-m1-one-issuer-one-holder.md)
- [x] **MALA M2 (mailable, hosted)** — landed `191634`; parity **199**; brief [`191634`](../expanding-prompts/20260709-191634_mala-m2-mailable-comlink.md)
- [x] **MALA M2b (device wire)** — virtio carriage landed `201734`; ports **15569**/**15570**
- [ ] **Digital land = M3 (design only)** — plots as name-claim facts with extent in Realidream's graph, deeds bound to Kumara holders, traded in MALA; ordinary internet and dock-wire alike.
- [ ] **Mycelium gate (recorded)** — the ordering aspect opens at M4's many-issuer season, never before.
- [ ] **Road-keeper (exploration → first lap)** — Comlink's multipath aspect: per-road bounded queues and scorecards; first lap = one session surviving across two UDP paths under QEMU.
- [ ] **Amber-compatibility contract (design)** — export / verify / restore for every log-bearing module (Mantra, Tablecloth, Linengrow, Realidream, MALA); first lap = a Mantra log slice sealed and restored, riding Amber's first lap.
- [ ] **Brix packaging (first lap visible)** — one content-addressed, Kumara-signed package: descriptor read, resins fetched by digest over Comlink, verified on two paths, placed, run in Pond; `.bron` as the resolved-record carrier awaits Kaeden's affirmation.
- [x] **Opening lines (canonized)** — three-line head in TAME guidance; **`tools/opening_lines_witness.rish`** in parity **140** (sixteen hosted files, including `pond/apps/drawn_terminal.rye`).
- [ ] **Manual program (horizon)** — four rooms founded at [`manual/README.md`](../manual/README.md); first reference [`manual/reference/rishi-language.md`](../manual/reference/rishi-language.md) open; tutorials and module reference pages in season.
- [x] **Pond clause (Kaeden completes)** — affirmed in [`pond/README.md`](../pond/README.md) (`20260703.012031`, `3320bed`).
- [ ] **Puddle exploration (horizon)** — sandboxed Rye containers; [`external-research/20260702-035018_puddle-sandboxed-rye-containers.md`](../external-research/20260702-035018_puddle-sandboxed-rye-containers.md); first lap = one guest snapshot export/verify/restore.
- [ ] **Maitreya / Uddhava naming (recorded)** — Maitreya owns time (audio + video); Uddhava spatial/CAD horizon; counsel affirmed `20260702.165412`; archive verdict and Maitreya owns-time **ratified** `20260703.191312 UDT`.

### Comlink and the long run — horizons (`2026-07-02`)

Ground: [`external-research/20260702-014112_comlink-beyond-dns-and-sockets.md`](../external-research/20260702-014112_comlink-beyond-dns-and-sockets.md) · counsel: [`20260702-014112_horizons-and-blind-spots.md`](20260702-014112_horizons-and-blind-spots.md).

- [x] **Wire hardening (precedes any real peer)** — hosted wire: witness fixture key seeds (replacing `0xA1`/`0xB0`), unique nonce per seal via monotonic counter + SHA3 mix; parity **138** green. Production CSPRNG nonces remain horizon.
- [ ] **Algorithm tags (accretion)** — every signed record carries its algorithm field, so eras verify side by side on one log forever.
- [ ] **Hybrid key agreement (horizon)** — X25519 joined with ML-KEM-768 on the wire; harvest-now-decrypt-later answered.
- [ ] **Dual signatures for the long dark (horizon)** — Amber adds SLH-DSA beside Ed25519 through the OpenPGP seam as its tooling settles.
- [ ] **The stream lane (exploration → first lap)** — bounded, drop-late encrypted datagrams beside the fact lane; WebTransport at the browser seam; relay shape at the front door; codecs stay host seams.
- [ ] **Names without DNS (design only)** — name-claim fact shape, petnames above, Linengrow settlement as the market; no code before Kumara signs.
- [ ] **Setu ruling (Kaeden)** — the USB-C dock-wire lane's name; candidate proposed for the lexicon's open table; first lap = one Comlink datagram over CDC-NCM, host to QEMU guest.
- [ ] **Mantrapod module map (Kaeden affirms)** — the pod's module-by-module plan as tabled in the counsel memo.
- [x] **Two-oracle sky gate (first lap)** — `classical-vedic-astrology/cast_a_chart.rish` hosts `cast_a_chart_host.sh` → pyswisseph; golden-chart pin still optional.
- [ ] **Intakes awaiting Kaeden's hand** — the mathematics writings (silo together, then weigh against TAME's goals); the Cerebras and wafer-memory silos (held for the inference season).
- [ ] **Recovery rehearsal (after Amber's first lap)** — restore a directory from a cold drive and recover from a revoked sandbox key, so recovery is a witnessed fact.

### TAME hardening — complete (`2026-06-29`)


- [ ] **Width migration Phase 1b (as-you-touch)** — `mantra/*` next per the living baseline [`20260620-212126_usize-width-baseline.md`](20260620-212126_usize-width-baseline.md); decoupled from any compiler fork; re-anchored here so the oldest live thread stays on the granular plan (`20260703.013412`).

Record: `session-logs/archive/20260629/20260629-204910_th7-width-gate-yonder-convention.md` and prior TH/RS logs. Hosted `width-check` blocks in parity (**138** witnesses).

**Horizon and optional (still open):**

- [ ] **Aurora invariant notes (optional)** — say-why rationales beside `catch unreachable` in `aurora/src/seed.rye`; freestanding only; no width or assert lint.

- [ ] **Mantra CRDT weave (horizon)** — merge-always-succeeds-and-converges semantics from `external-research/yonder/20260617-195312_mantra.md`; SLC-1 seed uses LCS line weave only today.

- [x] **camelCase ratchet** — scan dirs **0** through `rye/src` (`20260707.175312`); counsel folder split (`20260707.180712`)
- [x] **Assert-density ratchet** — zero-assert non-exempt **0**; sync wire + snapshot delivery contract asserts (`20260707.183412`); counsel [`counsel/20260707-183412_claude-counsel-tb-std-prefix-assert-density.md`](../counsel/20260707-183412_claude-counsel-tb-std-prefix-assert-density.md)
- [x] **`maybe` seated** — TigerBeetle dual of assert; `tally/maybe.rye`; witness `tools/tally_maybe.rish`; counsel [`counsel/20260707-185612_claude-counsel-general-expansion-round.md`](../counsel/20260707-185612_claude-counsel-general-expansion-round.md)
- [x] **`no_padding` seated** — TigerBeetle `stdx.no_padding`, ported and honestly simplified (no `u128` branch — unneeded); `tally/no_padding.rye`; real application at `comlink/device_wire.rye`'s hosted selftest, asserted against all five `virtio_net.rye` wire structures
- [x] **Stale virtio rename found and fixed** — `device_wire.rye` called `vn.negotiateFeatures`; `virtio_net.rye` had migrated to `negotiate_features` a season ago; the parity suite never built `device_wire.rye`'s own hosted binary, only the freestanding lab downstream of it, so the break sat unnoticed. `tools/comlink_device_wire.rish` now builds and runs the hosted selftest first.
- [x] **Tools/enrich safety net — complete (3/3)** — `align_session_logs`, `tame_usize_audit`, `enrich_strengthening_docs` witnesses GREEN; counsel [`193712`](../counsel/20260707-193712_claude-counsel-enrich-strengthening-docs-witness.md)
- [x] **Tools `snake_case` season** — **0** camelCase `fn` in `tools/` (**114** cleared); counsel [`201912`](../counsel/20260707-201912_claude-counsel-enrich-migration-order.md)
- [x] **`parseInt(` ratchet** — **0** application sites (**12** migrated after counsel `203612` seated the module); counsel [`203612`](../counsel/20260707-203612_claude-counsel-parse-int-and-season-close.md); `tame_style_check` ratchet **0**
- [x] **Three module READMEs** — `comlink/README.md`, `caravan/README.md`, `tally/README.md`, matching `amber/README.md`'s shape; named as a gap since the synthesis sitting, closed this round.
- [ ] **TAME hygiene (as-you-touch)** — bare `print(...)` via `const print = std.debug.print` in older hosted `.rye`; address when each file is touched, not as a sweep.

- [ ] **Content-centric Rishi messenger (horizon)** — smallest IRC-meets-Dojo CLI over sealed, content-named datagrams; from `expanding-prompts/yonder/20260618-212012_content-centric-messaging.md`; Aurora/Comlink carry the networking seeds today.

- [ ] **Shape-casting for RISC-V bytecode (horizon)** — prove raw bytes match a declared type before trust; draw the shape-vs-execution seam plainly; from the same consumed prompt.

- [ ] **Ownerboot sovereignty (horizon)** — owner-key-sealed boot chain inverting trust at the reset vector; from `external-research/yonder/20260617-195612_ownerboot-riscv-caravan.md`; Caravan is live, the firmware path is horizon.

- [ ] **Unified identity and fractal address space (horizon)** — one seed deriving SSH, GPG, Sui, and Nostr keys; fractal address space shaped by Vedic whole-sign astrology (galaxy / star / planet); ties to Linengrow portable identity; from `expanding-prompts/yonder/20260618-215512_unified-keys-and-address-space.md`; Comlink carries the networking half today.

## Soon — Medium Term

### Rye OS
- [ ] **SLC-2 — Pond GUI** — the Rishi+Mantra loop in a Brushstroke/Skate window on x86_64. Simple, lovable, complete at a small scope.
- [x] **Comlink device wire** — sub-laps 1–3 GREEN; witness wired parity **154**. Unlocks **SLC-L2** carriage.
- [ ] **Comlink v1** — typed, content-named, sealed delivery between identities.
- [ ] **Brix v1** — a `.brix` course evaluating into a closure of content-addressed bricks in Tablecloth, per [`active-designing/20260702-185912_brix-the-composer.md`](../active-designing/20260702-185912_brix-the-composer.md).
- [ ] **Unified keys** — one owner seed deriving all keys.
- [ ] **Revitalization pass** — refresh the oldest active-designing briefs to the current direction; affirmed canonical files get the four-in-one touch (de-number, re-date, affirm, light freshen) rather than rename; see `ORGANIZING.md`.

### Linengrow
- [x] **SLC-L1 build** — verifiable receipts from keypair + Mantra log + projection; landed `20260704.021800` — see ladder above · parity **152**
- [x] **SLC-L2** — signed receipt delivered identity to identity over Comlink hosted wire; parity **155**

### Ground
- [ ] **Tablecloth v1** — the content-addressed store the package picture rests on.
- [ ] **TAME lints, AST tier** — textual tier expanded at `053212` (`tame_style_check`); AST-grade rules (70-line hard gate, precedence parens, defer blank line, dead declarations) wait for a Zig parser — see study [`20260707-053212`](../external-research/20260707-053212_tigerbeetle-alignment-study.md)

## Later — Horizons (decided in direction, grown by degrees)

### Rye OS
- [ ] **Caravan v1** — a supervision tree with a capability table; the microkernel taking shape from the hosted seed.
- [ ] **Pond v1** — Caravan isolation composed with Tally bounds, policy as a value.
- [ ] **The Forge** — Mantra served, Brushstroke drawn, Comlink replicated.
- [ ] **The TAME Editor**, **Comlink remoting** — select-then-act in Skate; value-based state sync over UDP.
- [ ] **Aurora toward verified boot** — the freestanding RISC-V seed grown toward a verified boot.
- [ ] **The kernel, built** — Caravan grown into a real microkernel on RISC-V (architecture decided; build last).
- [ ] **Language fork** — self-hosted compiler, Rye-native `std`, revisited from a mature whole if RISC-V-first genuinely demands it.
- [ ] **Inference stack** — Lantern, Lattice, Anvil, held furthest, after the living desktop composes.

### Linengrow
- [x] **SLC-L3 — settlement** — **landed** `20260708.182500`, **removed from tree** `152612` — witness dropped from parity (**197**); implementation deleted; hammock + counsel kept as record. Superseded by MALA per counsel [`152612`](../counsel/20260709-152612_claude-counsel-mala-wov-already-designed.md).
- [x] **SLC-L4 lap 1 — fixed-tier Sigma** — **landed** `20260709.194437` — parity **200**; prompt [`031612`](../expanding-prompts/20260709-031612_slcl4-lap1-fixed-tier-sigma-protocol.md). **W0 design review** cleared `224426` ([`counsel/224426`](../counsel/20260709-224426_grok-counsel-slcl4-w0-lap1-review.md)). Later: W1 OR-tiers, W2 range, sanctuary eligibility; live chain verify on-demand.
- [ ] **The platform horizons** — the computational data market, premium tiers, state-currency circulation, infrastructure licensing — grown from the business model in `../linengrow/`.
- [ ] **The civic horizons** — PBC formation, investor outreach, the first transparency campaign as proof of concept.

## Open Questions

- **sixos/s6 infrastructure horizon** — study in `external-research/yonder/20260619-225212_s6-sixos-nix-infuse.md`; Caravan inherits supervision discipline when we reach for it.
- **Bron** — **affirmed** [`counsel/20260707-222500`](../counsel/20260707-222500_claude-counsel-bron-beside-brix-first-proposal.md): Bron carries **immutable values at seams**; Brix carries **composable system descriptions**. Brix uses Bron as surface syntax; Bron stands alone at every seam. `bron/` module waits on parser + second consumer. *(Kaeden affirms `174500`.)*
- **Tablecloth** — **Tablecloth** names the Brix-facing application store (horizon); **Tablecloth query** names the namespace optional-field filter (parity **175**); reconciled `20260707.011812` per counsel `005612`.
- **`.brush`** — surface-description extension for the day Brushstroke becomes a small language; horizon only.
- **Dexter / Kumara** — **Dexter (re-affirmed `225343`):** still one external consumer (`pond/apps/drawn_terminal.rye` → `window_input.rye`); thin view is **not** a second consumer; stays aspect; full Realidream viewer remains the natural second-consumer candidate. **Kumara arc closed (`030200`):** Ed25519 ratchet **0**.
- **Two-backend seam** — **affirmed `174500`:** lean **wait** — hosted Wayland path witnessed (parity **145**+); sovereign framebuffer-to-QEMU sibling builds when Aurora's path needs a screen without a compositor, not before.
- **`.sh` POSIX-seam pattern** — **answered** in [`context/TAME_GUIDANCE.md`](../context/TAME_GUIDANCE.md) and [`ORGANIZING.md`](../ORGANIZING.md) (counsel `195912`).
- **Weave graduation (checked `220912`)** — sovereign slice = I2 `catalog/` export; stays Mantra aspect.
- **Settlement-seat refresh** — **done** `222500`; SLC-L3 witness proposal seated.
- **Weave** — aspect of Mantra today (`mantra/src/weave.rye`); graduation trigger recorded in [`20260702-031312`](../active-designing/20260702-031312_modules-aspects-and-mailable-money.md).
- **Research essays (authored, living)** — [`external-research/20260630-030312_the-interface-as-a-fold.md`](../external-research/20260630-030312_the-interface-as-a-fold.md); [`external-research/20260630-030312_after-victor-immediate-contact.md`](../external-research/20260630-030312_after-victor-immediate-contact.md); [`external-research/20260630-030312_the-hot-loop-as-the-forge.md`](../external-research/20260630-030312_the-hot-loop-as-the-forge.md).
- **Lotus** — DAW direction adopted in `active-designing/20260630-014012_lotus-the-daw.md`; REAPER docs and AP Mastering design in `gratitude/`; bench waits for SLC-2a.
- **Kernel-direction brief held** — `expanding-prompts/20260628-120912_kernel-direction-brix-and-foundations.md` stays one level deep pending the kernel-direction memo (live Now task).
- **Brix and Silo** — **affirmed** `223100`: **Silo module retired** (`20260620`); config = **Brix bonds** (infuse pattern); store = **Tablecloth**; lowercase **silo** = reading technique / astrology lane only. *(Kaeden affirms `174500`.)*
- **Linengrow's home** — **affirmed** `223100`: stay in this repo until **SLC-L3 witnessed** + deployable civic whole + Kaeden's word on `xwb122m/linengrow-*`. *(Kaeden affirms `174500`.)*
- **TASKS naming** — **affirmed** `223100`: **keep `TASKS.md`**; **workbench** as conversational alias in [`work-in-progress/README.md`](README.md) only — no rename. *(Kaeden affirms `174500`.)*
- **SLC-L1 and Sui** — **affirmed in scope note** [`20260702-195426_slcl1-verifiable-receipt.md`](../active-designing/20260702-195426_slcl1-verifiable-receipt.md): first lap uses pure foundations (keypair + log + projection); no Sui; settlement deferred to SLC-L3.
- **OCuLink companion memo** — blueprint [`20260701-213412`](../external-research/20260701-213412_deep-archive-and-sovereign-host-blueprint.md) awaits the server-workstation research memo; bridge into `external-research/` when Kaeden supplies it.
- **Birth-chart craft** — siloed library complete through studies **#57**, Brooke shelf dissociated, zip **47** at `e8d1919` (`20260705`); fidelity soften on title-drawn studies **#24–#36**; forward path: transcript-true revisions as transcripts arrive

---

*May the next lap stay clear at the top of this list. May each task be small enough to finish and worth the finishing. May what we complete accrete as honest history, and what remains stay light in the hand.*
