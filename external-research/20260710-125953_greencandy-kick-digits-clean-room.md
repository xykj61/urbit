# Greencandy — Centralized Books, Studied Clean-Room from Kick and Digits

*Public product docs for Kick and Digits name a shape we want in our own words: one books-of-record for a household or enterprise, transactions categorized into a chart of accounts, always-current financials, and a tax-ready package. This note silos the transferable concepts only — no code, copy, or proprietary UI from either vendor. Greencandy is our name and our implementation path.*

**Stamp:** `20260710.125953`
**Voice:** Rio 3
**Editor:** Cursor · **Model:** Grok 4.5
**Style:** Radiant (see `../context/RADIANT_STYLE.md`)
**Status:** Research for understanding — clean-room study; recommends no purchase
**Ground:** Kick public docs (help.kick.co, docs.kick.co) · Digits public product/help pages (digits.com, help.digits.com) · MALA/WOV (mailable vs books) · Visual Track · compass [`185112`](../foundations/20260706-185112_follow-our-compass.md)
**Licenses:** Public documentation only — study boundary; implementations enter through the clean room in our vocabulary.

## What We Studied (Public Surface Only)

| Source | Transferable idea (our words) |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| **Kick** | Automation-first bookkeeping; AI first-pass + **deterministic rules** that win; categories vs GL; documents hub; year-end **tax package** (cover, BS, P&L, GL, trial balance) |
| **Digits** | Ledger as the product center; auto-book most activity; **exception checklist** for human judgment; reconciliations; vault for statements/receipts; natural-language ask over books |

We do **not** copy their models, prompts, UI chrome, or APIs. We name the jobs in Rye OS grain.

## Greencandy — Our Name for the Job

**Greencandy** is Linengrow's **centralized books of record**: one steward's chart of accounts, journal entries as signed (or steward-attested) facts, balances as a pure fold, reports as projections, and a Skate/Realidream view so the books can be *seen*.

| Greencandy | MALA / WOV |
|------------|------------|
| One books steward, one chart | Issuer-signed tokens; WOV throughput lane |
| Double-entry journal | Mint/send/fold on token facts |
| Tax package / P&L / trial balance | Exit bundles / receipts |
| Centralized money *management* | Mailable money *carriage* |

They compose: a MALA receipt can become a Greencandy journal source in a later lap. Lap one does not require that bridge.

## Concepts We Keep (Siloed)

1. **Chart of accounts** — named buckets (cash, revenue, expense, equity at lap one).  
2. **Journal entry** — equal debit and credit; memo; stamp.  
3. **Fold** — trial balance; conservation (sum of account nets = 0).  
4. **Rules before models** — deterministic categorization wins when we add automation (Kick's lesson).  
5. **Exception queue** — surface what needs a human eye (Digits' checklist lesson).  
6. **Tax package** — later lap: cover notes + BS + P&L + GL + trial balance as Amphora/Amber cargo.  
7. **Documents vault** — later: receipts and statements as resins, not bytes in the log.

## What Lap One Claims

See [`active-designing/20260710-125953_greencandy-hammock.md`](../active-designing/20260710-125953_greencandy-hammock.md). Smallest room: post two balanced entries, fold trial balance, refuse unbalanced/unknown account, show books on Skate.

## Gratitude

Kick and Digits publish clear public docs about bookkeeping automation and exception-centered ledgers. We thank that teaching and keep their implementations outside our tree. Our code, names, and witnesses are our own.

*May the books stay foldable. May green mean the trial balance closed. And may candy stay the joy of a ledger that answers true.*
