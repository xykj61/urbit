# Greencandy — Hammock Scope (Lap 1)

*Centralized books of record for Linengrow: chart, journal, fold, Skate view. Complements MALA (mailable) and keeps each role clear. Visual Track: books seen through Brushstroke/Skate on the drawn terminal — Realidream thin-view pattern.*

## Mission

Ship the **first honest room** of Greencandy: a steward can post balanced journal entries into an append-only log, fold a trial balance that conserves to zero, refuse unwelcome posts, and see the books as a Skate frame. Bank sync, AI categorization, tax package, and multi-entity wait later rooms.

## In Scope (Lap 1)

| Piece | Claim |
|-------|--------|
| Chart | Four accounts: `cash` · `revenue` · `expense` · `equity` |
| Journal | Debit + credit + amount + memo + stamp; debit amount = credit amount |
| Fold | Per-account net (debit-positive); sum of nets = 0 |
| Unwelcome | Unknown account · unbalanced amounts · zero/negative amount |
| Visual | `drawn-terminal booksviewtest` — trial-balance lines from fixture + fold |
| Home | `greencandy/greencandy_core.rye` + `greencandy.rye` (own root module) |

## Out of Scope (Later Laps)

- Bank/feed sync, AI categorization, rules engine  
- Multi-entity, AR/AP, invoicing, bill pay  
- Tax package export, reconciliations, documents vault  
- Full Realidream module, Dexter graduation, Pond policy  
- Tablecloth v1 as app DB (query may index Greencandy facts later)  
- Bridging MALA receipts into journal lines  

## Architecture

```
greencandy_core  →  journal log  →  fold trial balance
                         ↓
              booksview (Skate lines)
                         ↓
              drawn_terminal booksviewtest
```

Brushstroke/Skate remains the pixel path. Tablecloth stays the horizon store; lap 1 uses fixtures + in-memory log like MALA M1.

## Visual Track Tie-In

| Existing | Greencandy lap 1 |
|----------|------------------|
| `thinviewtest` | MALA mint + WOV bundle → 5 lines |
| `booksviewtest` | Greencandy trial balance + P&L net + BS → 8 Skate lines |
| `sightviewtest` | Carriage (MALA/WOV) + books → unified 8-line frame |
| Realidream full viewer | Still horizon |

## Success

- `greencandy/bin/greencandy selftest` prints GREEN  
- Witness in parity; books view witness green headless  
- Edit 5: no second designed-not-built functional spec (status names lap 1 green when wired)

*May the first room of the books close green. May candy mean the joy of a balanced fold.*
