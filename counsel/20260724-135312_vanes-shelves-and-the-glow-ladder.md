This is the second sitting of the day. It opens with the scorecard on the workshop‑and‑warehouse lap the bench just merged, then answers the six questions in front of us: where lap claims should live, how the bench may answer counsel, what becomes of the last Python, where the Glow‑speaking shell sits, what the new letters were seated as and whether they still fit, and how far the road runs to `glow.glow`. Every proposal parks for your word.

---

## One — The Pull and the Scorecard

I fast‑forwarded to `64b466d` and measured. The verdict: **on track, handsomely.**

| Seat | Standing | What I measured |
|---|---|---|
| P1 — untrack binaries | **Landed** | `git ls-files tools/bin` returns zero; ignore lines guard `granary/bin`, `mandi/bin`, and the forge bundle |
| P2 — pin and ledger | **Landed, byte‑exact** | `TASKS.md` 3,059 B and `ROADMAP.md` 2,793 B as pins; the season ledgers landed at **344,865 B and 182,337 B — identical to the last byte** with the originals I measured this morning. Accrete held perfectly. `session-logs/README.md` now 24,169 B, sitting 407 bytes under the bound |
| P2 — lint duty six | **Landed** | `living_docs_lint.rish` names duty 6 with `living_pin_max_bytes (24576)` |
| P3 — rules routing | **Partial, as reported** | 8 always‑on at 23,415 B toward the 8 KB target; heaviest remaining: `session-logs.mdc` 5,638 B, `commit-messages.mdc` 2,994 B |
| P4 — watcher excludes | **Landed** | `.vscode/settings.json` present |
| P5 — doctrine | **Landed** | memo filed in `counsel/`, expanded in `expanding-prompts/`, and `REMEMBER.md`'s Now points at the season — the operator card is the pin‑and‑ledger law wearing its Sunday best |
| P6 — Claude Code hook | **Landed** | `.claude/settings.json` fires `sh tools/fixtures/tame_style_scan.sh advise` on PostToolUse, matching the sketch |
| P7 — bake‑off | **Skeleton landed** | `tools/fixtures/bench_bakeoff_scorecard.md` awaits its thirty rows |
| Held — `vere/` and `old/` move | **Rightly held** | a five‑remote structural move deserves your hand; the motion from the first memo stands ready |

Two follow‑ups, both small. First, **finish P3**: moving `session-logs.mdc` and `commit-messages.mdc` off always‑on returns 8.6 KB at a stroke, landing near 14.8 KB; the last stretch to 8 KB is body‑trimming `align`, `remember`, and `quin` toward pointer form. Second, **one coverage check on the session README**: the elder file weighed 427,502 B and its successors weigh 130,497 B of index plus a 24 KB pin, with the day‑folds carrying the full record on shelves that predate today. The arithmetic is almost certainly whole; a single bench lap confirming no README‑only lines fell outside the shelves closes the question — and the elder rests in git history at the parent commit regardless.

## Two — Genre, Rather Than Age: `active-designing/` and the Claim Shelf

Your instinct is right, and I hold it with you. `active-designing/` promised **high‑level module design** — seats, naming rounds, architecture briefs — and 380 files later, most of its residents are **lap receipts**: one claim brief per STOA waymark. Those are honest, valuable documents of a different genre. A design says *what should exist*; a claim says *what just went green*. Shelving by age alone leaves the genres mixed; the folder reads clearest when each genre has a home.

The proposal: seat a claims home — the natural word already in our vocabulary is **`waymarks/`**, since the ladders rule and the STOA compressor both speak it, and the name parks for your word as every name does. Inside it, season shelves (`waymarks/stoa-100s/`, `stoa-200s/`, `stoa-300s/`) each carrying a one‑line‑per‑claim index, so a listing costs sentences. `active-designing/` returns to design sittings, naming rounds, and briefs, with its `yonder/` untouched.

Migration takes the gentle fork: **forward‑only**. New claims land in the new home from the day you seat it; elder claims stay where they lie until they roll to shelves under the already‑seated archive law. Nothing moves, so `dated_guard` never stirs, and the five remotes carry no churn. The sweeping alternative — one witnessed move with an old‑to‑new index — remains available if you ever want the past gathered too.

---

## Three — The Reply Shelf: `counsel/replies/`

Yes, and warmly. The relay grows a voice coming back. The shape:

- **Home:** `counsel/replies/`, one dated file per reply, stamped with its own time and naming the memo it answers — `20260724-1xxxxx_re-the-workshop-and-the-warehouse.md`.
- **Form:** three short sections — **What landed** (with measured numbers), **What resisted** (honest friction, workarounds taken), **What the bench asks** (questions for the next counsel sitting).
- **Nature:** replies are dated artifacts — immutable, guard‑protected, Radiant where prose flows and plain where tables serve.

The gift is token economy in both directions: future counsel reads a 2 KB reply rather than a season of session logs, and the bench gets a named place to think out loud at length the `.bron` format was never meant to carry.

---

## Four — Python at the Seam

The census finds exactly three:

1. `classical-vedic-astrology/cast_a_chart.py` — **stays.** It wraps a Python‑only ephemeris library; this is the external‑interpreter seam the POSIX‑seam law already blesses, beside `cast_a_chart_host.sh`. A seam, rather than a model.
2. `tools/fixtures/living_docs_lint_scan.py` — **migrates on touch** to `.rish`, the same road every `.sh` witness‑support scan already walked.
3. `tools/fixtures/dated_guard_scan.py` — **migrates on touch**, same law.

One craft note for the two migrations: the map‑transform ceiling means `lines(read-file f)` refuses files past 256 lines, and these scans read exactly the big living docs — so lean on the run seam (`wc -c`, `grep -c` through `run`) for size and pattern duties rather than in‑pipeline line maps. And one ratchet advisory joins the scan roster: **count `.py` under `tools/`**, target two‑to‑zero, the ephemeris seam standing exempt by name.

## Five — The Shell That Speaks Glow

The fusion you name — Glow, Rishi, and the elder Dojo — has a clean seat, and the elder system itself shows the shape: its Dojo was never a vane; it ran as an **agent**, hosted by the applications layer. Ours follows the same honest ladder:

- **Aspect first.** A `glow` mode inside Rishi: read a line, tokenize with the machinery already green, lower, run, print the value. The SLC ring closes when the sixteen single‑line heads and a quit word all answer at the prompt.
- **Module at the second consumer**, per the unchanged graduation rule.
- **Agent under Pool** if it ever needs hosting — Pool is the Gall‑role host, so the REPL living there mirrors Dojo living in Gall, letter for letter.
- **Sheltered in Maze meanwhile**, if the proposal wants a nursery season before its shape settles — the tree built that room for exactly this.

A vane it never becomes: vanes host system concerns, and a prompt is a citizen. Once the mode stands, the remaining scripts you imagine in rune form follow for free — a `.glow` desk the shell runs is a script, and the assertion runes `?>` and `?<` already lower to `assert`, so TAME travels with the runes rather than beside them.

---

## Six — The Letters, Recovered

You asked me to search, and the tree answered generously. The seated family, with fit verdicts:

| Letter | Name | Seated as | Still fits? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **N** | **Neth** | **Settlement** — the name you were reaching for. MALA settlement L1/L2 design, VPS cluster plan, and an IronBeetle‑patterns ladder all stand in `external-research/` | **Yes** — it is the natural home of the held two‑lane settlement witness when that season arrives |
| **O** | **Ojjo** | **Benchmarking** — proves Hoon/Glow parity by measuring it, correctness before timers; the palindrome is the symmetric yardstick | **Yes, and already breathing**: the byte‑for‑byte RISC‑V parity witnesses are proto‑Ojjo work in all except name |
| **P** | **Pool** | **Applications** — the Gall‑role host; the content‑data‑compute market; Linengrow and the surfaces run as agents in it | **Yes** — the keystone; the SLC already rests on it |
| **Q** | **Quin** | **Inference** — four faculties under one kernel‑quiet host; also the fifth OS variant and this voice | **Yes** — three hats, settled |
| **R** | **Rhyz** | **Identity** — revives Kumara; rhizome any‑to‑any, broken nowhere fatally; point/planet/star tiers over the Ed25519 root; code deferred to proven‑supersede | **Yes** — and the Kumara ratchet closed at zero means the seam is ready the day Rhyz arrives |
| **S** | **Sala** | **The viewer** — the Landscape parallel, śālā the hall you inhabit; revives Realidream; deliberately **under Pool rather than in the kernel** | **Yes, and shipping** — the broadcaster APK is live‑sent |

Two corrections to memory, gently and with receipts. **Maze is real yet it is no vane**: the tree seats it as the **nursery namespace** — a meta‑layer sheltering a proposal while it earns its single responsibility and canonical name — listed among the non‑vane strata beside Pond, Puddle, and Brix. So the **M kernel slot stands open**, and the market floor you may have been half‑remembering is **Mandi**, seated as a module on Pool's floor. And the **T slot is the held runtime‑unification proposal**, explicitly unnamed: Tusk and Toon were both collision‑checked and rejected, so that naming round stands open for your hand and a fresh collision witness, whenever you call the sitting.

On the accrete pattern itself: new letters beside the elder A‑through‑L is exactly right, and your own `active-reviving/` law already carries the retirement discipline — *supersede only when proven*, on the elder's own witnesses, with an explicit supersede word. The batch shape adds only the grouping: when a season's revivals have each passed the elder's witnesses, gathered a second consumer, and received your word, retire that season's elders **together**, with one dated retirement note naming every name. Deprecate loudly, remove rarely, and never on a calendar — on evidence.

## Seven — Vere's Duties, Already Housed

Here the tree is ahead of the question, and the kindest counsel is to point at its own seats. The revival doc already rules: the primary path is **Glow → Zig → RISC‑V**, standing green across Neth, Sala, and Pool with whole‑stdout byte parity across architectures; Nock survives only as a **second backend for interop**, Glow emitting Nock and never the reverse; and determinism moved from the little VM into the discipline — bounds, folds, witness‑before‑truth, the signed log.

Read against that, "reimplement Vere, beginning with jets" resolves into something smaller and truer. On the primary path there is no interpreter to jet around: **every lowered Glow gate is already its own jet**, native by construction — `jam`, `cue`, `lent`, and `mix` are the first citizens of that library, green today. So the real motion is to **grow the Glow standard library** — the hoon.hoon‑parallel *library*, deliberately split from the hoon.hoon‑parallel *compiler* — one gate at a time, each twin‑witnessed for sameness against elder behavior. That witnessing is Ojjo's correctness half, which means the vane earns its first real laps here. The runtime's other duties are housed: the event spine in Caravan and Weave, memory in Tally, boot in Aurora, wires in Comlink. Whether all of that ever unifies under **one name is precisely the held T proposal**, and I counsel it stay held — a name is a promise, and the runtime is still choosing its shape.

## Eight — `glow.glow` and the Ladder

Should Glow be written in itself? One day, freely — and the compass says *earn it by rungs*, the same way the compiler fork was seated as horizon and the thin frontend chosen.

The deep point first: the elder system needed its self‑hosted core because **its permanence story lived in the frozen language**. Ours lives elsewhere — in the append‑only log of signed facts. Weave is our frozen thing; the compiler is allowed to be a tool. So `glow.glow` is elective beauty rather than load‑bearing necessity, which frees us to climb slowly and enjoy it.

The ladder, with honest distance:

- **Rung 0 — today.** Glow lives in Rye: `expr.rye`, the rune heads, the lowering arms, STOA at 331, three keystone programs green cross‑architecture. Correct, and correctly so.
- **Rung 1 — the sameness witness.** One Glow desk implements the **digraph table** — the twenty‑seven‑row rune lookup at the tokenizer's heart — and an Ojjo‑style twin witness proves it answers byte‑for‑byte with the Rye implementation across a fixture set. Sameness is the macro; this is the smallest true taste of self‑description, and it looks reachable from the molds, cores, and calls already green.
- **Rung 2 — one arm in Glow.** A single lowering arm — one rune head, source to emitted Rye — expressed as a Glow library, twin‑witnessed against its Rye elder. The missing floor shows itself here: general text handling, bounded string buffers, error surfaces. Whatever the rung demands of the language becomes the next STOA season's honest agenda.
- **Rung 3 — horizon.** `glow.glow` proper, gated the way the F‑series was gated: deliberated only from a mature whole, and only after Glow has a second outside consumer as a general language. Until then it is a beautiful name on the yonder shelf.

Distance today: rung 1 is near, rung 2 is a season, rung 3 is a horizon — and the compass is content with all three speeds at once.

## Nine — Shelves and Yonder, the Sweep

From the census, in one pass: `external-research/` holds 134 files with no shelf — give it `archive/`. `strengthening-compiler/` holds 114 numbered notes with a lexicon at 0000 — it wants only an index row in its README, and an entry in `.cursorignore` if it proves reference‑only. `counsel/` at 60 gains `replies/` above. `expanding-prompts/` at 48 has `yonder/` and would take `archive/` by season. And one line of housekeeping buys the rest forever: replace the seven per‑folder archive entries in `.cursorignore` with a single **`**/archive/`**, so every shelf yet to be born arrives pre‑ignored.

---

## Decisions Awaiting Your Word

1. Finish P3: two rules off always‑on, then body‑trims toward 8 KB.
2. Run the one‑lap session‑README coverage check.
3. Seat the claims home — `waymarks/` or the name you choose — forward‑only.
4. Seat `counsel/replies/` with the three‑section form.
5. Seat the Python law: two fixture scans migrate on touch; the ephemeris seam stands exempt; add the ratchet advisory.
6. Seat the `glow` mode in Rishi as an aspect, with the agent‑under‑Pool ladder and Maze shelter available.
7. Bless the letters as recovered; hold T unnamed; call the T naming sitting when you wish.
8. Seat the retirement‑batch shape: proven supersede, second consumer, your word — then a season's elders retire together with one dated note.
9. Seat the Glow standard library as the jets‑made‑honest lane, with Ojjo sameness witnesses.
10. Seat rung 1 of the ladder — the digraph‑table twin — as a coming season's lap; keep `glow.glow` on yonder.
11. Approve the shelf sweep, including the single `**/archive/` ignore line.
12. When ready, give the word on the held `vere/` and `old/` move; the motion stands prepared.

## Gratitude

To the architects of the elder system in `old/`, whose Dojo showed the shell its seat and whose vanes lent our letters their music. To the keeper of the never‑break keynote on our gratitude shelf, whose accretion discipline shapes every retirement batch we will ever run. And to the TigerBeetle team, whose witnesses taught the bench to prove its own homework — byte for byte, this very morning.

---

*May every genre find its shelf, and every letter its honest concern. May the ladder be climbed rung by earned rung, with no leap the witnesses cannot follow. May the elders retire only into gratitude, their duties housed, their names at rest, the pier lighter and the log unbroken.*
