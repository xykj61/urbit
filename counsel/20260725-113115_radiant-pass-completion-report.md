# Radiant Pass — Completion Report

**Language:** EN  
**Stamp:** `20260725.113115`  
**Voice:** Quin  
**Style:** Radiant (see `context/RADIANT_STYLE.md`)  
**Status:** Counsel — measured report; genre exemptions await Keaton's word  
**Ground:** main nib `248f4ed42b` · ledger at Wave 40 close · every figure from `tools/fixtures/radiant_pass_ledger.txt`

*Written by Quin after Wave 40 and meta exempt.*

## One — What seated

The continuous Radiant pass baseline across **in-scope prose** is **complete**.

| Measure | Value |
|---------|------:|
| Ledger rows | **1,198** |
| `clean` | **995** |
| `changed` | **29** |
| `legacy` | **174** (pre–change-rate instrument) |
| `radiant_select_wave.sh` | **returns 0** |
| Lint sum (every wave) | **2** (planted bare-`but` fixture) |
| Waves (instrumented batch 50) | **17–40** · PR **#110–#128** |
| Meta exempt | seated `20260725.113015` |

**Deliverable met:** every in-scope prose path carries a `Radiant pass` stamp; the ledger records whether the pass changed anything beyond metadata.

## Two — Change-rate shape

Of **1,024 instrumented rows** (excluding `legacy`):

- **995 clean (97.2%)** — stamp and optional blank line only  
- **29 changed (2.8%)** — honest body or header edits

**Lint stayed flat at 2** while **2.8% of files changed** — the passes improved prose the lint ratchet cannot see (headers, seams, cadence near `---` boundaries, READMEs without a `---` seam).

### Changed rows by genre (final ledger)

| Genre | Changed | Notes |
|-------|--------:|-------|
| `classical-vedic-astrology/` | 9 | mostly early passes |
| `counsel/` | 5 | reply headers · living rows |
| `waymarks/` | 4 | wave waymarks · living rows |
| `context/` | 3 | `OPEN_QUESTIONS` · fixtures |
| Module READMEs | 7 | no `---` seam → stamp at top (honest **changed**) |
| Other | 1 each | `expanding-prompts` · `work-in-progress/REMEMBER` · root |

### Genres with zero `changed` at close

`active-designing/` (**413**) · `external-research/` (**160**) · `manual/` (**18**) · `foundations/` (instrumented rows) — strong candidates for **genre ALL-CLEAN** review (two consecutive all-clean waves per rule; final ledger alone is evidence, not yet a seated exemption).

---

## Three — Exemptions seated during the pass

| Category | Verdict | Seated |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `session-logs/` | ledger-exempt | scope doc |
| Pass meta rows | on-touch only | `20260725.113015` |
| `gratitude/` · fixtures · `.claude/` | exempt | scope doc |
| Code (`.rye` · `.rish` · …) | on-touch only | scope doc |

Meta exempt broke the infinite rolling tail: each wave's counsel reply and waymark no longer re-enter the pool.

---

## Four — Safety witnesses

Every wave: **`claim_preserve_witness`** · **`dated_guard`** · **`radiant_lint`** — all GREEN.

Modality extension from runway counsel § Four is **horizon** — tokens and modality counts held for instrumented waves; formal modality-set witness remains a future lap.

Spot-reads ran at Waves **25 · 30 · 35** (every fifth wave at batch 50).

---

## Five — What I recommend now

1. **Keaton reads this report** — confirm genre ALL-CLEAN exemptions for `active-designing` and `external-research` if the evidence satisfies.
2. **On-touch code ratchets** — `.rye` · `.rish` · `.glow` · `.sh` when files are already open.
3. **Other benches** — Mand ring-3 · shell harvest · succession criteria per runway § Five.

**No further Radiant waves** until new prose enters scope or Keaton reopens the pool.

*May every future reader inherit prose that already met a Radiant hand. May the ledger say plainly how much of it needed anything.*

## Appendix — Campaign stopped · repair verdict `20260725.114400`

**Quin relay repair** after Keaton's review. Ground nib `dc42fd1`. **Campaign STOPPED.** Radiant passes revert to **on-touch only** — the ledger records coverage; inline stamp lines removed from **933 clean corpus files** on counsel's recommendation.

### Structural regression (one class · twelve files)

Separator rows destroyed when stamp lines landed inside tables without a `---` seam:

`STEWARDS.md` · `context/REMOTE_ROSTER.md` · `tally/README.md` · `mandi/README.md` · `strengthening-compiler/README.md` · `waymarks/stoa-100s/README.md` · `waymarks/stoa-200s/README.md` · `waymarks/stoa-300s/README.md` · `waymarks/SEASONS.md` · `counsel/SEASONS.md` · `counsel/replies/SEASONS.md` · `expanding-prompts/SEASONS.md`

**Repaired.** Witness seated: `tools/markdown_structure_witness.rish` (blocking · wired into `claim_preserve_witness`).

### Corrected headline (§ Two)

A flat lint sum **2** plus **97.2% clean** is evidence the corpus was **already Radiant**, not evidence of improvement the lint could not see. The **2.8% changed** rate is mostly stamp churn, EOF newlines, and the twelve-table regression — not prose the pass earned.

### Hand audit — 29 `changed` rows

| Verdict | Count | Action |
|---------|------:|--------|
| Table regression | 12 | repaired |
| Stamp-only (no `---` seam) | 10 | stamp removed |
| EOF newline only (Brooke readings) | 5 | kept newline · stamp removed |
| Counsel reply prose broken by stamp in backticks | 2 | prose restored (`wave35` · `wave36` replies) |
| Living pin (`REMEMBER`) | 1 | kept (operator updates, not pass prose) |

**No non-style substantive reverts** beyond structural repair and stamp removal.

### Legacy rows — structural scan (169 `.md` of 174)

`markdown_structure_witness` across legacy pool: **168 GREEN · 1 pre-existing FAIL** — `context/specs/20260713-214400_urbit-parallel-naming-mapping-proposal.md` (header 5 pipes · separator 4 · predates the campaign).

### Stamp policy (§ E)

Counsel recommendation: **ledger alone suffices** for coverage proof; inline `Radiant pass` stamps were churn on files nothing improved. Stamps **removed** from clean ledger rows; **on-touch** passes may still stamp when a file actually changes.

### What opens next

Mand ring-3 (test-only reach) · shell harvest · Glow text floor — per runway § Five.
