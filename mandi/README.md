## What this room is

Mandi names the offer: a signed `vessel-listing-v1` binds `vessel_parent` + MALA price under Kumara (seed `0x67`). The receipt is a digest of the canonical body — quiet about buyer and seller. A sale closes with `vessel-settle-v1` (seed `0x68`) binding that receipt to a payment digest of MALA send + WOV transfer. Amphora purchase delivery remains the carriage rite.

**Sister room:** Granary holds the weave-sharing four doors. Mela and Haat stay parked as warm siblings.

## Lap 1

| Piece | Role |
|-------|------|
| `mandi_core.rye` | Sign / verify / receipt / parent bind |
| `mandi.rye` | Selftest binary |
| `tools/mandi_lap1.rish` | Witness → parity **238** |

```sh
rishi/bin/rishi run tools/mandi_lap1.rish
```

## Floor view (lap 2)

Citizen window on Skate — five lines: floor title, vessel parent prefix, price, receipt prefix, fold green. Lying listing refused.

```sh
rishi/bin/rishi run tools/mandi_floor_view.rish
```

Witness → parity **240** (`mandiviewtest`).

## Listing settle (lap 3)

In-process close: listing receipt + `vessel-payment-v1` (MALA send digest + WOV transfer digest) under seed `0x68`. Refuses zero, lying, mismatches, overdraft, insufficient, double settle.

```sh
rishi/bin/rishi run tools/mandi_listing_settle.rish
```

Witness → parity **242**.

## Settle view (lap 4)

Citizen window on Skate — six lines: settle title, listing receipt, price, payment prefix, settled, fold green. Double settle refused.

```sh
rishi/bin/rishi run tools/mandi_settle_view.rish
```

Witness → parity **244** (`mandisettletest`).

## Held

Live TigerBeetle settlement rests until its own gate.
